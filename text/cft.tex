\section{$\N=4$ super Yang-Mills}

Here we describe the theory that is the main interest of the thesis.

\subsection{The theory and its action}

Write the action, maybe also show dimensional reduction from 10d. Talk about observables: traces, Wilson lines. 

Planar limit.

\subsection{Symmetry}

Talk about conformal symmetry, write down the algebra ? Oscillator representation ? Discuss subgroups of psu(2,2|4), closed sectors. 

Since it's a CFT we want to find 2pt and 3pt function. The spectral problem.

\subsection{Weak coupling}

Take a simple operator, e.g. Konishi and calculate the anomalous dimension using perturbation theory ?

\subsection{String description: AdS/CFT}

Here we talk about the alternative description of the theory as strings moving in AdS.

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Planar diagrams are string interactions.

\subsubsection{String theory and the duality}

Give details of the string theory, what are the parameters on both sides, how they match up. What are the limits. Anomalous dimensions match string state energies.

\subsection{Testing the duality: BMN, GKP, FT}

Describe these limits, give first eveidence for the duality. Is this where one finds the first strong coupling coefficient to Konishi ?
