\section{String description: AdS/CFT}

Here we talk about the alternative description of the theory as strings moving in AdS.

\subsection{Motivation}

Planar diagrams are string interactions.

\subsection{String theory and the duality}

Give details of the string theory, what are the parameters on both sides, how they match up. What are the limits. Anomalous dimensions match string state energies.

\subsection{First tests: BMN, GKP, FT}

Describe these limits, give first eveidence for the duality. Is this where one finds the first strong coupling coefficient to Konishi ?
