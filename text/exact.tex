Exact results are rare and important.

\subsubsection{The $\pmu$-system}


In this section we review the formulation of the $\bP\mu$-system, and also discuss its symmetries which will be useful later.
Below, we will restrict the discussion to states in the $sl(2)$ sector as presented in \cite{PmuPRL}.
Remarkably, the general case is not much more complicated and will appear soon in \cite{PmuLong}.

%\subsection{Definitions and notation}

The $\pmu$-system is a nonlinear system of functional equations for a four-vector $\bP_a(u)$ and a $4\times4$ antisymmetric matrix $\mu_{ab}(u)$ depending on the spectral parameter $u$.
For full details about the origin of the construction we refer the reader to \cite{PmuLong}. As functions of $u$, both $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ have prescribed analyticity properties which play a key role.
First, $\bP_a$ must have only a single branch cut in $u$ going between $-2g$ and $2g$, being analytic in the rest of the complex plane. We call this cut the \textit{short} cut, while the cut on the real
line connecting the same two points through infinity is called the \textit{long} cut. The functions $\mu_{ab}$ have an infinite set of short branch cuts going between $-2g+in$ and $2g+in$ for all $n\in\mZ$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:cuts}). Most importantly, the analytic continuation of $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ through these cuts is again expressed in terms of these functions, according to the following equations:
\beq
\tilde \bP_a=-\mu_{ab}\chi^{bc}\bP_c,\; \ \ \ \text{with}\;\ \ \chi^{ab}=\left(
            \begin{array}{cccc}
              0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
              0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
              0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
              1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
            \end{array}
          \right),
\label{eq:Pmu}
\eeq
and
\beq
\tilde \mu_{ab}-\mu_{ab}=\bP_a \tilde\bP_b-  \bP_b \tilde\bP_a\;.
\label{eq:mudisc}
\eeq
Here we denote by $\tilde\bP_a$ and $\tilde\mu_{ab}$ the analytic continuation of $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ through the cut on the real axis. In addition, we have a pseudo-periodicity condition
\beq
\label{muper}
	\tilde\mu_{ab}(u)=\mu_{ab}(u+i)
\eeq
which, actually, means that $\mu_{ab}(u)$ would be an $i$-periodic function if defined with long cuts instead of the short cuts.

% }
The functions $\mu_{ab}$ are also constrained by the relations
\beqa
\label{constraint}
\mu_{12}\mu_{34}-\mu_{13}\mu_{24}+\mu_{14}^2&=&1\;,\\
\label{Pmulast}
\mu_{14}=\mu_{23}\;,
\eeqa
the first of which states that the Pfaffian
 of the matrix $\mu_{ab}$ is equal to $1$. Let us also write the equations \eq{eq:Pmu} explicitly:
\beqa
\label{eq:pmuexpanded1}
&&\tilde \bP_1= -\bP_3 \mu_{12}+\bP_2 \mu_{13}-\bP_1 \mu_{14} \\
&&\tilde \bP_2= -\bP_4 \mu_{12}\hspace{16mm}+\bP_2 \mu_{14}-\bP_1 \mu_{24} \\
&&\tilde \bP_3= \hspace{16mm}-\bP_4 \mu_{13}+\bP_3 \mu_{14}\hspace{16mm}-\bP_1 \mu_{34} \\
&&\tilde \bP_4= \hspace{16mm}\hspace{15.5mm}-\bP_4 \mu_{14}+\bP_3 \mu_{24}-\bP_2 \mu_{34}\;.
\label{eq:pmuexpanded}
\eeqa
The above equations ensure that the branch points of $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ are of the square root type, i.e.
$\tilde{\tilde{\bP}}_a=\bP_a$ and $\tilde{\tilde{\mu}}_{ab}=\mu_{ab}$.


Finally, we require that $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ do not have any singularities except these branch points\footnote{For odd values of $J$ the functions $\bP_a$ may have an additional branch point at infinity. However, it should cancel in any product of two $\bP_a$'s, and therefore it will not appear in
any physically relevant quantity (see \cite{PmuPRL}, \cite{PmuLong}). We will discuss some explicit examples in the text.}.

	






%\subsection{Asymptotics and energy}
The quantum numbers and the energy of the state are encoded in the asymptotics of the functions $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ at large real $u$. The generic case is described in \cite{PmuLong}, while here we are interested in the states in the $sl(2)$ sector, for which the relations read \cite{PmuPRL}
\beq
\bP_a\sim(A_1u^{-J/2},A_2u^{-J/2-1},A_3u^{J/2},A_4u^{J/2-1})
\label{eq:asymptotics}
\eeq
\beq
	\(\mu_{12},\ \mu_{13},\ \mu_{14},\ \mu_{24},\ \mu_{34}\)\sim
	\(u^{\Delta-J},\ u^{\Delta+1},\ u^{\Delta},\ u^{\Delta-1},\ u^{\Delta+J}\)
\label{eq:muasymptotics}
\eeq
where $J$ is the twist of the gauge theory operator, and $\Delta$ is its conformal dimension. With these asymptotics, the equations \eq{eq:Pmu}-\eq{Pmulast} form a closed system which fixes $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$.

Lastly, the spin $S$ of the operator is related \cite{PmuPRL} to the leading coefficients $A_a$ of the $\bP_a$ functions (see \eq{eq:asymptotics}):
\beqa
&&A_1 A_4=\frac{\((J+S-2)^2-\Delta^2\)\((J-S)^2-\Delta^2\)}{16 i J(J-1)} \label{AA1} \\
&&A_2 A_3=\frac{\((J-S+2)^2-\Delta^2\)\((J+S)^2-\Delta^2\)}{16 i J(J+1)} \label{AA2}\;.
\eeqa


%\subsection{Symmetries}
%\label{sec:Symmetries}
The $\bP\mu$-system enjoys a symmetry preserving all of its essential features. It has the form of a linear transformation of $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ which leaves the system \eqref{eq:Pmu}-\eqref{Pmulast} and the asymptotics \eq{eq:asymptotics}, \eq{eq:muasymptotics} invariant. Indeed, consider a general linear transformation $\bP_a'={R_a}^b \bP_b$ with a non-degenerate constant matrix $R$. In order to preserve the system \eqref{eq:Pmu}, $\mu$ should
at the same time be transformed as
\beq
\mu'=-R \mu \chi R^{-1}\chi.
\label{gammaP}
\eeq
Such a transformation also preserves the form of \eqref{eq:mudisc} if
\beq
R^T\chi R\chi=-1\;,
\label{eq:sxsx}
\eeq
which also automatically ensures antisymmetry of $\mu_{ab}$ and (\ref{constraint}), (\ref{Pmulast}).
In general, this transformation will spoil the asymptotics of $\bP_a$.
These asymptotics are ordered as $|\bP_2|<|\bP_1|<|\bP_4|<|\bP_3|$,
which implies that the   matrix $R$ must have the following structure\footnote{This matrix would of course be lower triangular if we ordered $\bP_a$ by their asymptotics.}
 \beq
R=\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
 * & * & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & * & 0 & 0 \\
 * & * & * & * \\
 * & * & 0 & * \\
\end{array}
\right).
\eeq
The general form of $R$ which satisfies \eqref{eq:sxsx} and does not spoil the asymptotics generates a 6-parametric transformation, which we will call a $\gamma$-transformation. The simplest \text{$\gamma$-transformation} is the following rescaling:
\beq
\bP_1 \to \alpha \bP_1\;\;,\;\;
\bP_2 \to \beta \bP_2\;\;,\;\;
\bP_3 \to 1/\beta \bP_3\;\;,\;\;
\bP_4 \to 1/\alpha \bP_4\;\;,\;\;
\label{eq:alphabeta}
\eeq
\beq
\mu_{12} \to \alpha\beta\mu_{12}\;\;,\;\;
\mu_{13} \to \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\mu_{13}\;\;,\;\;
\mu_{14} \to \mu_{14}\;\;,\;\;
\mu_{24} \to \frac{\beta}{\alpha}\mu_{24}\;\;,\;\;
\mu_{34} \to \frac{1}{\alpha\beta}\mu_{34}\;\;,\;\;
\eeq
with $\alpha,\beta$ being constants.


 In all the solutions we consider in this paper all functions $\bP_a$ turn out to be functions of definite parity, so it makes sense to consider $\gamma$-transformations which preserve parity. $\bP_1$ and $\bP_2$  always have opposite parity (as one can see from from \eqref{eq:asymptotics}) and thus should not mix under such transformations; the same is true about $\bP_3$ and $\bP_4$. Thus, depending on parity of $J$ the parity-preserving $\gamma$-transformations are either

\beqa
\label{gammatransform2}
&\bP_3\rightarrow\bP_3+\gamma_3\bP_2,\ \bP_4\rightarrow\bP_4+\gamma_2\bP_1,\\
\nn&\mu_{13}\rightarrow\mu_{13}+\gamma_3\mu_{12},\ \mu_{24}\rightarrow\mu_{24}-\gamma_2\mu_{12},\ \mu_{34}\rightarrow\mu_{34}+\gamma_3\mu_{24}-\gamma_2\mu_{13}-\gamma_2\gamma_3\mu_{12}
\eeqa
for odd $J$ or
\beqa
\label{gammatransform1}
&\bP_3\rightarrow\bP_3+\gamma_1\bP_1,\ \bP_4\rightarrow\bP_4-\gamma_1\bP_2,\\
\nn&\mu_{14}\rightarrow\mu_{14}-\gamma_1\mu_{12},\ \mu_{34}\rightarrow\mu_{34}+2\gamma_1\mu_{14}-\gamma^2_1\mu_{12}\;,
\eeqa
for even $J$.

\subsection{Cusped Wilson line}


The observable which we will be considering is the same as in \cite{Gromov:2012eu},\cite{Correa:2012hh} and \cite{Drukker:2012de}: it consists of two rays of a supersymmetric Wilson line forming a cusp with the angle $\phi$ and an operator $Z^L$ inserted at the cusp, where $Z$ is a scalar of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM (see figure \ref{fig:WL}). To completely define a supersymmetric Wilson line we should also specify the coupling to scalars, which is parameterized by a six-dimensional unit vector $\vec n(t)$ at each point of the line ($t$ being a parameter on the line). In our case $\vec n(t)$ is constant and equal $\vec n$ on one ray and $\vec n_\theta$ on another ray, so that $\vec n\cdot \vec n_\theta=\cos\theta$. Due to the R-symmetry the observable depends on $\vec n,\vec n_\theta$ only through $\theta$.
% \begin{figure}[t]
	% \centering
		% \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{WLcusp.pdf}
	% \caption{The cusped Wilson line with an operator insertion.}
	% \label{fig:WL}
% \end{figure}
 Explicitly the observable is defined as
\beq
\label{WilsL}
	W_L={\rm P}\exp\!\int\limits_{-\infty}^0\! dt\(i  A\cdot\dot{x}_q+\vec\Phi\cdot\vec n\,|\dot x_q|\)\times Z^L\times {\rm P}\exp\!\int\limits_0^\infty\!dt\(i A\cdot\dot x_{\bar q}+\vec\Phi\cdot\vec n_\theta\,|\dot x_{\bar q}|\).
\eeq
Due to the cusp the expectation value of such an observable diverges as
\beq
\left\langle W_L\right\rangle \sim \(\frac{\Lambda_{IR}}{\Lambda_{UV}}\)^{\Gamma_L(\lambda)},
\eeq
where $\Lambda_{IR}$ and $\Lambda_{UV}$ are the infra-red and ultraviolet cut-offs respectively \cite{Polyakov:1980ca},\cite{Correa:2012at}. The quantity $\Gamma_{L}$, which we will call the cusp anomalous dimension, will be the main object of our studies.
When $\theta^2-\phi^2=0$ the observable $W_L$ becomes BPS and the cusp anomalous dimension vanishes \cite{Drukker:2006xg}. In \cite{Gromov:2012eu} the anomalous dimension in the near-BPS limit $\theta=0$, $\phi\rightarrow 0$ was calculated using the method of Y-system or Thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz \cite{Gromov:2009tv,Bombardelli:2009ns,Arutyunov:2009ur}. In \cite{Gromov:2013qga} the calculation was generalized to the case of arbitrary, but close to each other angles $\theta^2-\phi^2\rightarrow 0$. In this general case the cusp anomalous dimension was found to be
\beq
\label{eq:mainresultIntro}
\Gamma_L(\lambda)=\frac{\phi-\theta}{4}\partial_\theta\log\frac{\det{\cal M}_{2L+1}}{\det{\cal M}_{2L-1}}+{\cal O}((\phi-\theta)^2),
\eeq
where ${\cal M}_N$ is an $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ sized matrix defined as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:M}
&\({\cal M}_N\)_{ij} =I^\theta_{i-j+1},\\
&I_n^\theta =i^{n+1}I_n\(\frac{\sqrt{\lambda}}{\sin\beta}\)\sin{n\beta}, \;\;\;\; \mathrm{with} \;\; \sin{\beta}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\theta^2/\pi^2}},
\nonumber
\end{align}
 and $I_n(x)$ are modified Bessel functions of the first kind. In \cite{Gromov:2013pga} the result for the case $L=0\ ,\theta=0$ was re-derived in a significantly shorter way by using the novel $P-\mu$ system.


The AdS/CFT duality allows one to relate the observable in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM described above to an open string in AdS which ends on a cusped line on the boundary of AdS. In particular, in the classical scaling limit when $L$ and $\lambda$ are both taken to infinity with $L/\sqrt{\lambda}$ fixed, we can match $\Gamma_{L}$ with the energy of the classical string. However, since the result contains determinants of $(2L+1)\times (2L+1)$ sized matrices it is not obvious how to take the large  $L$ limit. In the subsequent sections we develop the apparatus for this, describe the classical string solution and finally compare the results for the energy.

\subsubsection{Classical limit}



Taking the classical limit $L \rightarrow \infty$ keeping $L/\sqrt{\lambda}$ fixed becomes considerably easier once we realize that the cusp anomalous dimension \eqref{eq:mainresultIntro} can be expressed in terms of an expectation value of some operator in a matrix model. In this section we will show how to use this approach to find the large $N$ expansion of the determinant of ${\cal M}_N$ defined in \eqref{eq:M}.

One can check that the quantities $I^\theta_n$ defined in the previous section can be rewritten in the following integral representation
\begin{equation}
	I_n^\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint \frac{dx}{x^{n+1}} \sinh(2\pi g \, (x + 1/x)) \, e^{2 g \theta (x - 1/x)},
\end{equation}
where the integration contour is the unit circle and $g=\frac{\sqrt\lambda}{4\pi}$. This makes it possible to write the determinant of ${\cal M}_{N}$ as
\beq
\det \M_{N}=
\oint\prod_{i=1}^{N+1}\frac{dx_i}{2\pi i} e^{2 g \, \theta \left(x_i-\frac{1}{x_i}\right)} \sinh \left(2 \pi g \left( x_i + \frac{1}{x_i} \right) \right) \times \det X,
\eeq
where
\beq
\det X = \left|
\bea{lllll}
x_1^{-2}&x_1^{-1}&\dots&x_1^{N-1}&x_1^{N-2}\\
x_2^{-3}&x_2^{-2}&\dots&x_2^{N}&x_2^{N-1}\\
\vdots&\vdots& \ddots & \vdots& \vdots\\
x_{N}^{-N-1}&x_{N}^{-N}&\dots&x_{N}^{-2}&x_{N}^{-1}\\
x_{N+1}^{-N-2}&x_{N+1}^{-N-1}&\dots&x_{N+1}^{-3}&x_{N+1}^{-2}
\eea
\right| = \frac{\prod_{i<j}^{N+1} (x_i - x_j)}{\prod_{i=1}^{N+1} x_i^{i+1}},
\eeq
and we recognize the numerator as the Vandermonde determinant $\Delta(x_i)$. We can further simplify the final result by anti-symmetrizing the denominator, which we can do because everything else in the integrand is anti-symmetric and the integration measure is symmetric w.r.t $x_i$, thus under the integral we can replace $\det X$ by
\beq
	\det X' = \frac{\Delta^2(x_i)}{(N+1)!} \, \prod_{i=1}^{N+1} \frac{1}{x_i^{N+2}}.
\eeq
Thus finally we get the following expression
\begin{equation}
  \det \M_{N} = \frac{1}{(2 \pi i)^{N+1}} \oint \prod_{i=1}^{N+1} \frac{d x_i}{x_i^{N+2}} \, \frac{\Delta^2(x_i)}{(N+1)!}  \, \sinh(2\pi g \, (x_i + 1/x_i)) \, e^{2 g \theta (x_i - 1/x_i)},
  \label{eq:Mintegral}
\end{equation}
which indeed has the structure of a partition function of some matrix model\footnote{Namely, it is equal to the partition function of a two-matrix model. We thank I.Kostov for discussions related to this question.}. It now becomes a matter of simple algebra to convince oneself that the cusp anomalous dimension \eqref{eq:mainresultIntro} can be written in terms of expectation values in this matrix model, namely
\beq
	\Gamma_L(g) = g \, \frac{\phi-\theta}{2} \left[ \,\, \left< \sum_{i=1}^{2L+1} \( x_i - \frac{1}{x_i}\)  \right>_{2L+1} - \,\,\, \left<  \sum_{i=1}^{2L-1} \(x_i - \frac{1}{x_i}\) \right>_{2L-1} \right],
\eeq
where $\left< \dots \right>_{N}$ denotes the normalized expectation value in the matrix model of size $N$ with the partition function defined in (\ref{eq:Mintegral}). Note that this formula is exact and we have not yet taken any limits.


In this section we will explore the classical $L\sim\sqrt \lambda\rightarrow \infty$ limit of the matrix model \eqref{eq:Mintegral}.  As usual in matrix models, when the size of matrices becomes large, the partition function is dominated by the solution of the saddle point equations. In the leading order it is just equal to the value of the integrand at the saddle point. Here we work in this approximation, leaving the corrections (beyond the first one calculated in section \ref{sec:The1loop}) for future work.


The partition function \eqref{eq:Mintegral}  can be recast in the form \footnote{we take $N=2L$.}
\beq
	\det \M_{2L} = \frac{1}{(2 \pi i)^{2L+1}} \frac{1}{(2L+1)!} \, \oint \prod_{i=1}^{2L+1} d x_i \, e^{-S(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{2L+1})},
\eeq
where the action is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
	S &=& \sum_{i=1}^{2L+1} \[ 2 g \theta  \( x_i - \frac{1}{x_i} \)  - \(2L + 2\) \log x_i \] + 2 \sum_{i<j}^{2L+1} \log(x_i - x_j) + \\ \nonumber
	       &+& \sum_{i=1}^{2L+1} \log \sinh \( 2 \pi g \( x_i + \frac{1}{x_i} \) \).
\end{eqnarray}
The saddle point equations $\partial S / \partial x_j = 0$ now read\footnote{Technically the $x_j^{-1}$ term has a coefficient of $L+1$, but since we are taking $L \rightarrow \infty$ we chose to neglect it for simplicity.}
\begin{equation}
	g \theta \left( 1 + \frac{1}{x_j^2} \right) - \frac{L}{x_j} + \sum_{i \neq j}^{2L+1} \frac{1}{x_j - x_i} + \pi g \left( 1- \frac{1}{x_j^2} \right) \coth \left( 2 \pi g \left( x_j + \frac{1}{x_j} \right) \right) = 0.
\end{equation}
We can further simplify them by noting that a large coupling constant $g$ appears inside the cotangent and since the roots $x_i$ are expected to be of order 1, with exponential precision
it is possible to replace
\begin{equation}
	\coth \left( 2 \pi g \left( x_j + \frac{1}{x_j} \right) \right) \approx \mathrm{sgn}(\mathrm{Re}(x_j)).
\end{equation}
Finally we bring the equations to a more canonical and convenient form and get the following result,
\begin{equation}
	-\theta \, \frac{x_j^2 + 1}{x^2_j - 1} + \frac{L}{g} \frac{x_j}{x_j^2 - 1} - \frac{1}{g} \frac{x_j^2}{x_j^2 - 1} \sum_{i \neq j}^{2L+1} \frac{1}{x_j - x_i} = \pi \, \mathrm{sgn}(\mathrm{Re}(x_j)).
	\label{eq:saddlepoint}
\end{equation}
An alternative way of finding these values $x_i$ is to consider the following quantity $P_L(x)$, which played an important role in \cite{Gromov:2012eu},
\beq
P_L(x)=\frac{1}{\det {\cal M}_{2L}}\left|\begin{matrix}
I_1^{\theta}& I_0^{\theta}& \cdots & I_{2-2L}^{\theta}  &I_{1-2L}^{\theta}\\
I_2^{\theta}& I_1^{\theta}& \cdots & I_{3-2L}^{\theta} &I_{2-2L}^{\theta}\\
\vdots      &  \vdots     &\ddots & \vdots            &\vdots           \\
I_{2L}^{\theta}& I_{2L-1}^{\theta}& \cdots & I_{1}^{\theta}  &I_{0}^{\theta}\\
x^{-L}& x^{1-L}& \cdots & x^{L-1} &x^{L}\\
\end{matrix}\right|.
\label{eq:PLrepr}
\eeq
The numerator is the same as $\det \M_{2L}$ except in the last line $x_{2L+1}$ is replaced by $x$ which is not integrated over. In the classical limit all integrals are saturated by their saddle point values, i.e. one can remove the integrals by simply replacing $x_i \rightarrow x_i^{cl}$. If we replace $x$ with any saddle point value $x_i^{cl}$ the determinant will contain two identical rows and will automatically become zero, thus the zeros of $P_L(x)$ are the saddle point values. On the complex plane they are distributed on two arcs as shown in figure \ref{fig:roots}. As expected, for the case $\theta=0$ we recover two symmetric arcs on the unit circle \cite{Gromov:2012eu}.
% \begin{figure}[t]

	% \label{fig:roots}
% \end{figure}


Now, following \cite{Gromov:2007aq},\cite{Beisert:2005bm},\cite{Gromov:2012eu}, we introduce the quasimomentum $p(x)$ as
\begin{equation}
	p(x) = -\theta \, \frac{x^2 + 1}{x^2 - 1} + \frac{L}{g} \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} - \frac{2L}{g} \frac{x^2}{x^2 - 1} \, G_L(x),
	\label{eq:quantum_quasimomentum}
\end{equation}
where the resolvent $G_L(x)$ is
\begin{equation}
	G_L(x) = \frac{1}{2L} \sum_{k=1}^{2L+1} \frac{1}{x-x_k}.
	\label{eq:resolvent}
\end{equation}
The motivation for introducing $p(x)$ is that  the saddle point equations (\ref{eq:saddlepoint}) expressed through $p(x)$ take a very simple form
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{2} \left( p(x_i + i \epsilon) + p(x_i - i \epsilon) \right) = \pi \, \mathrm{sgn}(\mathrm{Re}(x_i)).
	\label{eq:pepsilon}
\end{equation}
In the classical limit the poles in the quasimomentum condense and form two cuts. The shifts $\pm i\epsilon$ in the equation above refer to taking the argument of the quasimomentum to one or the other side of the cut.


The quasimomentum \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum} introduced in the previous section is a convenient object to consider when taking the classical limit $L\sim \sqrt \lambda\rightarrow\infty$, because in this limit it is related to the algebraic curve of the corresponding classical solution. In this section we will construct this curve explicitly.

In the classical limit the poles of $p(x)$, which we denote as $x_i$, are governed by the saddle-point equation and condense on two cuts in the complex plane, as shown in figure \ref{fig:roots}.
The saddle-point equation \eqref{eq:saddlepoint} has a symmetry $x\rightarrow -1/x$, so does the set of poles $x_i$. For the quasimomentum (\ref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum}) this symmetry manifests as the identity $p(x) = -p(-1/x)$. Thus we conclude that the two cuts are related by an $x\rightarrow -1/x$ transformation. This and the invariance of the saddle-point equation under complex conjugation implies that the four branch points can be parameterized as $\{r\,e^{i\psi},r \, e^{-i\psi},-1/r \, e^{i\psi},-1/r \, e^{-i\psi}\}$. Note that in the case $\theta=0$ the symmetry is enhanced to $p(x)=-p(-x)$ and $p(1/x) = p(x)$, which is not true for arbitrary $\theta$.

The crucial point to notice is that while $p(x)$ satisfies the equation \eqref{eq:pepsilon} which has different constants on the right hand side for the two different cuts, the corresponding equation for $p'(x)$ has a zero on the right hand side for both cuts, thus we expect $p'(x)$ to have a simpler form than $p(x)$. Our strategy is to write down an ansatz for the derivative $p'(x)$ using the symmetries and analytical properties of $p(x)$ and then integrate it. The form of the expression we get is analogous to the curve constructed in \cite{Kazakov:2004qf}, which also helps us to construct the ansatz.

First, $p(x)$ has four branch points and according to \eqref{eq:pepsilon} its derivative changes sign on each cut, hence all the cuts are of square-root type. One can write $p'(x)\propto 1/y(x)$, where
 \beq
 	y(x) = \sqrt{x-r e^{i \psi}}\sqrt{x-r e^{-i \psi}}\sqrt{x + \frac{1}{r} e^{i \psi}}\sqrt{x + \frac{1}{r} e^{-i \psi}}.
 \label{eq:y}
 \eeq
  Second, since the algebraic curve is obtained from \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum} in the classical limit, $p(x)$ should have simple poles at $x=\pm 1$. Finally, from \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum}  we can get the behaviour at infinity:
\beq
	p'(x) \approx \frac{L}{g} \frac{1}{x^2} + \mathcal{O}\(\frac{1}{x^3}\).
\eeq
By using the knowledge about these singularities and asymptotics we can fix $p(x)$ completely. Based on what we know up to now we write down our ansatz for the derivative
\beq
	p'(x) = \frac{A_1 x^4 + A_2 x^3 + A_3 x^2 + A_4 x + A_5}{(x^2 - 1)^2 \, \sqrt{x-r e^{i \psi}}\sqrt{x-r e^{-i \psi}}\sqrt{x + \frac{1}{r} e^{i \psi}}\sqrt{x + \frac{1}{r} e^{-i \psi}}}.
\eeq
The polynomial in the numerator is of order four in order to maintain the correct asymptotics, and below we fix its coefficients using the properties of the quasimomentum.\footnote{Comparing with the asymptotic one can immediately see that $A_1 = L/g$, however our objective is to express $p(x)$ solely in terms of $r$ and $\psi$, which parameterize the algebraic curve.}

 The $x\rightarrow-1/x$ symmetry for the derivative implies that $A_1 = A_5$ and $A_2 = -A_4$. Next, simple poles at $x=\pm 1$ in $p(x)$ require zero residues of $p'(x)$ at $x=\pm1$, which fixes $A_2$ to be
\beq
	A_2 =- \frac{(2A_1 + A_3) \, r \, (r^2 - 1) \cos \psi}{r^4 - 2 \, r^2 \, \cos 2\psi + 1}.
\eeq
We fix the two remaining unknowns $A_1$ and $A_3$ after integrating the $p'(x)$. We don't write the intermediate results of the integration as the expressions are enormous without any apparent structure.
Looking back at \eqref{eq:pepsilon} we see that at the branchpoints
\beq
	p(x_{bp}) =\pm \pi.
\eeq
We use this condition to fix $A_1$ and we get

\beq
	A_1 = \frac{A_3}{2}\frac{K_1-E_1}{E_1+K_1-2\,a^2 \, K_1\cos^2(\psi)},
\eeq
where
\beq
E_1=\mathbb{E}\(a^2\sin^2(\psi)\),\;K_1=\mathbb{K}\(a^2\sin^2(\psi)\),\;a = \frac{2r}{r^2+1}.
\label{eq:E1K1}
\eeq
Finally we can use the $x \rightarrow -1/x$ symmetry on the quasimomentum itself, as before we only used it on the derivative. Imposing the symmetry yields

\beq
	A_3 = \frac{8}{a}\(E_1+K_1-2\,a^2\,\cos^2(\psi)K_1\).
\eeq
As expected, after plugging  these coefficients into $p(x)$ (and using the identities from the Appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic}) the whole expression simplifies enormously and we are left with our main result
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:pmainresult}
	p(x) &= \pi - 4\,i\,  E_1\, \mathbb{F}_1(x) + 4\,i\,  K_1\, \mathbb{F}_2(x) - a \left( \frac{x+ r e^{-i\psi}}{x+\frac{1}{r} e^{i\psi}} \right) \left(\frac{2/r\,e^{i \psi}}{x^2 - 1} \right) y(x)\,K_1,
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{F}_1(x) = \mathbb{F}\left( \left. \sin^{-1} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{x -r e^{-i\psi}}{x+ \frac{1}{r} e^{i\psi}} \right) \left( \frac{ e^{ i \psi}}{ia\,r\sin\psi} \right)} \; \right| a^2 \sin^2(\psi) \right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{F}_2(x) = \mathbb{E}\left( \left. \sin^{-1} \sqrt{ \left( \frac{x -r e^{-i\psi}}{x+ \frac{1}{r} e^{i\psi}} \right) \left( \frac{ e^{ i \psi}}{ia\,r\sin\psi} \right) } \; \right| a^2 \sin^2(\psi) \right).
\end{equation}
We verified this result numerically by comparing it to the extrapolation of the discrete quasimomentum \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum} at large $L$ and got an agreement up to thirty digits. We also compared this expression at $\theta = 0$ with the quasimomentum obtained in \cite{Gromov:2012eu} and the expressions agree perfectly.

The resulting quasimomentum is parameterized in terms of the branchpoints, i.e. the parameters are the radius $r$ and angle $\psi$. They are determined in terms of $L/g$ and $\theta$, which are parameters of the matrix model. We already mentioned that $L/g$ is simply the constant $A_1$, which we found to be

\beq
	\frac{L}{g} = 4\,\frac{K_1-E_1}{a} ,
	\label{eq:Lgfixed}
\eeq
and looking back at \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum} we see that $\theta = p(0) = -p(\infty)$, hence
\beqa
	\theta &=& -\pi + \frac{2a}{r}\,e^{i\psi}K_1 \nonumber \\
	       &-& \left. 4 \, i \, K_1\,\mathbb{E}\left(\sin ^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{  e^{i\psi}}{ia\,r\sin\psi}} \,\right|\, a^2 \sin ^2(\psi )\right)\nonumber \\
           &+& \left. 4 \, i \, E_1\, \mathbb{F}\left(\sin ^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{  e^{i\psi}}{ia\,r\sin\psi}}\,\right|\, a^2 \sin ^2(\psi )\right).
           \label{eq:thetafixed}
\eeqa

In the next section the two equations above will be matched with two analogous equations following from the classical string equations of motion.


As we have mentioned before, in the classical $L\sim\sqrt{\lambda}\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\Gamma_L(\lambda)$ can be matched with the energy of an open string. In this section we will describe the corresponding string solution and find the classical energy.

The class of string solutions we are interested in was introduced in \cite{Correa:2012hh} and generalized in \cite{Gromov:2012eu}. It is a string in $AdS_3\times S^3$ governed by the parameters $\theta,\phi$, $AdS_3$ charge $E$ and $S^3$ charge $L$; the four parameters are restricted by the Virasoro constraint. The ansatz for the embedding coordinates of $AdS^3$ and $S^3$ is
\begin{align}
y_1+iy_2=e^{i\kappa\tau}\sqrt{1+r^2(\sigma)},\;\; y_3+iy_4=r(\sigma) e^{i\phi(\sigma)},\\
x_1+ix_2=e^{i\gamma\tau}\sqrt{1+\rho^2(\sigma)},\;\; x_3+ix_4=r(\sigma) e^{i f(\sigma)}.
\label{eq:embedding}
\end{align}
The range of the worldsheet coordinate is $-s/2<\sigma<s/2$, where $s$ is to be found dynamically. The angles $\theta$ and $ \phi$ parameterizing the cusp enter the string solution through the boundary conditions $\phi(\pm s/2)=\pm (\pi-\phi)/2$ and $f(\pm s/2)=\pm\theta/2$. The equations of motion and Virasoro constraints lead to the following system of equations (see Appendix E of \cite{Gromov:2012eu} for more details, also \cite{Drukker:2011za}):
\begin{align}
f(\gamma,l_\theta)&=f(\kappa,l_{\phi}),
\label{eq:ff}
\\
h(\gamma,l_{\theta})=\theta, &\;\; h(\kappa,l_{\phi})=\phi,
\label{eq:hh}
\\
g(\gamma,l_\theta)=L, &\;\; g(\kappa,l_\phi)=E,\label{eq:gg}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
f(\gamma,l)&=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\gamma^2+k^2+1}}\,\mathbb{K}\left(\frac{-k^2+\gamma^2+1}{k^2+\gamma^2+1}\right),
\label{eq:f}
\\
h(\gamma,l)&=\frac{2l}{k(1+k^2-\gamma^2)}\left[(1+\gamma^2+k^2)\,\Pi\left(\frac{k^2-2l^2-\gamma^2+1}{2k^2}\,\vline\,\frac{k^2-\gamma^2-1}{2k^2}\right)-\right.
\nonumber
\\ & \left.-2\gamma^2\,\mathbb{K}\left(\frac{k^2-\gamma^2-1}{2k^2}\right)\right],
\label{eq:h}
\\
g(\gamma,l)&=-2\sqrt{2} \, \frac{\sqrt{\gamma^2+k^2+1}}{\gamma}\left[\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{-k^2+\gamma^2+1}{k^2+\gamma^2+1}
\right)-\mathbb{K}\left(\frac{-k^2+\gamma^2+1}{k^2+\gamma^2+1}
\right)\right],
\label{eq:g}
\\
k^4&=\gamma^4-2 \gamma^2+ 4\, \gamma^2 l^2+1.
\nonumber
\end{align}

One can see that the variables $\theta,l_{\theta},\gamma$ and $L$ are responsible for the $S^3$ part of the solution, while  $\phi,l_{\phi},\kappa$ and $E$ are their analogues for $AdS_3$. The two parts of the solution are connected only by the Virasoro condition which leads to \eqref{eq:ff}.
We are interested in the limit when $\theta\approx\phi$. In this limit the two groups of variables responsible for $S^3$ and $AdS_3$ parts of the solution become close to each other, namely $l_{\theta}\approx l_{\phi}$ and $E\approx L$. The cusp anomalous dimension should be compared with the difference $E-L$, because $L$ is the classical part of the dimension of the observable $W_L$. To find $E-L$ we linearize the system \eqref{eq:f},\eqref{eq:h},\eqref{eq:g} around $\phi\approx\theta$, which yields
\begin{align}
E-L=(\phi-\theta)\left|\frac{\partial{(g,f)}}{\partial{(l,\kappa)}}\right|/\left|\frac{\partial{(h,f)}}{\partial{(l,\kappa)}}\right|.
\label{eq:ELbig}
\end{align}
Plugging in here the explicit form of $g,f$ and $h$ one gets as a result an extremely complicated expression with a lot of elliptic functions. However, there exists a parametrization in which the result looks surprisingly simple: this parametrization comes from comparison of the string conserved charges with the corresponding quantities of the algebraic curve. One can notice that the equations for $\theta$ and $L/g$ in the end of the last section have the same structure as the equations \eqref{eq:hh} and \eqref{eq:gg}. Indeed, it is possible to match them precisely if one chooses the correct identification of parameters of the string solution $l_\theta,\gamma$ with the parameters of the algebraic curve $r,\psi$. We used the elliptic identities presented in the appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic} to bring the equations to identical form after the following identifications
\beq
\gamma=\frac{2r}{\sqrt{r^4-2r^2\cos2\psi+1}},\; l_{\theta}=\frac{(r^2-1)\cos\psi}{\sqrt{r^4-2r^2\cos2\psi+1}}.
\label{eq:identification}
\eeq
As another confirmation of correctness of this identification, after plugging it into \eqref{eq:ELbig} the complicated expression reduces to the following simple formula for the classical energy
\begin{align}
E-L=g(\phi-\theta)(r-1/r)\cos\psi.
\label{eq:E1}
\end{align}
Notice that this can be rewritten as a sum over the branch points of the algebraic curve
\begin{align}
&E-L=\frac{g}{2}(\phi-\theta)\sum\limits_i a_i,
\end{align}
where $a_i=\{r \, e^{i\psi}, r \, e^{-i\psi},-1/r \, e^{i\psi},-1/r \, e^{-i\psi}\}$.


In this section we will find the classical limit of the cusp anomalous dimension from the algebraic curve. At large $L$ the formula \eqref{eq:mainresultIntro} can be rewritten as
\beq
\Gamma_L(g)=\frac{\phi-\theta}{4}\partial_\theta\partial_L\det{\cal M}_{2L}.
\eeq
Use the integral representation \eqref{eq:Mintegral} for $\det{\cal M}_L$ we can notice that
\beq
\partial_\theta \log \det {\cal M}_L=\left\langle 2g\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2L}(x_i-1/x_i)\right\rangle,
\eeq
where by the angular brackets we denoted an expectation value in the matrix model with the partition function \eqref{eq:Mintegral}.
In the quasiclassical approximation the expectation value is determined by the saddle-point, i.e. the previous expression is equal to  $2g\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2L}(x_i-1/x_i)$, where the roots $x_i$ are the solutions of the saddle-point equation \eqref{eq:saddlepoint}.
Since the set of the roots has a $x\rightarrow-1/x$ symmetry, the two terms in the sum give the same contribution. Thus
\beq
\partial_\theta \log \det {\cal M}_L=-4g \sum\limits_{i=1}^{2L}\frac{1}{x_i}=8 \, g \, L \, G(0),
\eeq
where we used the resolvent \eqref{eq:resolvent}.

Using the relation \eqref{eq:quantum_quasimomentum} between the resolvent and the quasimomentum  we find $G(0)=\frac{g}{L}\left(p''(0)/4-\theta\right)$, so the final expression for the cusp anomalous dimension in terms of the quasimomentum is
\begin{align}
\Gamma_L(g)=-\frac{g^2}{2}\partial_Lp_L''(0).
\label{eq:E2}
\end{align}
The formula for $p(x)$ presented in the previous section is given in terms of the parameters of the branch points $r$ and $\psi$. They are implicitly defined through $L/g$ and $\theta$ by the equations \eqref{eq:Lgfixed} and \eqref{eq:thetafixed}. In order to get $\Gamma_L$ we express $\partial_L$ though $\partial_r$ and $\partial_\psi$ and then apply \eqref{eq:E2} to \eqref{eq:pmainresult}. Finally we obtain a very simple result in terms of $r$ and $\psi$
\beq
\Gamma_{L}(g)=g(\phi-\theta)\(r-1/r\)\cos\psi
\label{eq:GammaL}
\eeq
which exactly coincides with the calculation from the string solution!


Here we will check our formula \eqref{eq:GammaL} in the limit $\phi=0$ and $\theta\rightarrow 0$ considered in section E.2 of \cite{Gromov:2012eu}. As the angles go to zero, the branch points approach the unit circle: $r\rightarrow 1$, thus the formula \eqref{eq:GammaL} gives
\beq
	\Gamma_L(g)=2\,g\,\theta (r-1)\cos\psi.
\eeq
In this limit $r-1\propto\theta$, and the coefficient of proportionality can be found by expanding\footnote{The equation \eqref{eq:thetafixed} is written in the approximation $\phi\approx\theta$ and now on the top of it we want to take a limit $\theta\rightarrow 0$. Since before we have neglected the terms ${\cal O}(\theta-\phi)^2$, the result, which is now of the order ${\cal O}(\theta)^2$ will not generally be reproduced. However, we found that here and in several other formulas correct small angle limit is reproduced if before taking $\theta,\phi$ to zero we replace $\theta$ and $\phi$ by the middle angle $\phi_0=\frac{\phi+\theta}{2}$, which is in our case equal to $\theta/2$.} the equation \eqref{eq:thetafixed} for $\theta$ around $r=1$:
\beq
	2 (1-r)\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(\sin^2\psi\right)}{\cos\psi}=\theta/2.
\eeq
Plugging it into the formula above we get
\beq
\Gamma_L(g)=g\,\theta^2 \,\frac{\cos^2\psi}{2\mathbb{E}\left(\sin^2\psi\right)}
\eeq
which perfectly agrees with (190) of \cite{Gromov:2012eu}.

%\subsection{The 1-loop correction to the classical energy}
%\label{sec:The1loop}
Now that the classical limit of the cusp anomalous dimension is calculated, we can consider corrections to it. In the limit $L\sim \sqrt\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ which we are studying here
the perturbative expansion around the classical value can be written as
\beq
\Gamma_L(g)=\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty g^{1-n}b_n(L/g)+\text{non-perturbative terms}.
\label{eq:Gammaexp}
\eeq
The classical energy is $g \, b_0(L/g)$ and other corrections are suppressed by powers of $g$. A symmetry of the formula for $\Gamma_L(g)$ found in \cite{Beccaria:2013lca} allows one to express the even terms in the expansion \eqref{eq:Gammaexp} through the odd ones and the other way round. In particular, $b_1$ can be obtained from $b_0$ by differentiating with respect to $L/g$.
Since the classical energy is
\beq
\Gamma^{cl}_L(g)=g\(\phi-\theta\)\(r-1/r\)\cos\psi
\eeq
by differentiating it with respect to $L/g$ we find that the perturbative part of energy in the first two orders in the classical expansion is
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_L(g)=g\(\phi-\theta\)\(r-1/r\)\cos\psi \left(1+\frac{1}{g}f(r,\psi)\right),
\label{eq:correctedenergy}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
f(r,\psi)=\frac{r+1/r}{4}\frac{\left|r^2e^{2i\psi}+1\right|^2K_1-r^2 \left|r+\frac{1}{r}+e^{i\psi}-e^{-i\psi}\right|^2E_1 }{\left|\(r+\frac{1}{r}\)\(r^2e^{2i\psi}-1\)E_1-\(r-\frac{1}{r}\)\(r^2e^{2i\psi}+1\)K_1\right|^2},
\end{align}
and $E_1,K_1$ are defined in \eqref{eq:E1K1}. We have checked this formula and the classical energy \eqref{eq:E1} against a numerical extrapolation of the exact expression \eqref{eq:mainresultIntro} and found an agreement up to more than thirty digits.


Find the curve, matrix models.

\subsection{Revisiting the slope function}

In this section we will find the solution of the $\bP\mu$-system \eqref{eq:Pmu}-\eq{Pmulast} corresponding to the $sl(2)$ sector operators at leading order in small $S$. Based on this solution we will compute the slope function $\gamma^{(1)}(g)$ for any value of the coupling.

The solution of the $\pmu$-system is a little simpler for even $J$, because for odd $J$ extra branch points at infinity will appear in $\bP_a$ due to the asymptotics \eq{eq:asymptotics}. Let us first consider the even $J$ case.

The description of the $\bP\mu$-system in the previous section was done for physical operators. Our goal is to take some peculiar limit
when the (integer) number of covariant derivatives
$S$ goes to zero.  As we will see this requires some extension of the asymptotic requirement for $\mu$ functions.
 In this section we will be guided by principles of naturalness and simplicity to deduce these modifications which
 we will summarize in section~\ref{sec:ancont}. There we also give a concrete prescription for analytical continuation in $S$, which we then use to derive the curvature function.

We will start by finding $\mu_{ab}$. Recalling that $\Delta=J+{\cal O}(S)$, from \eq{AA1}, \eq{AA2} we see that $A_1A_4$ and $A_2A_3$ are of order $S$ for small $S$, so we can take the functions $\bP_a$ to be of order $\sqrt{S}$. This is a key simplification,
because now \eq{eq:mudisc} indicates that the discontinuities of $\mu_{ab}$ on the cut are small when $S$ goes to zero. Thus at leading order in $S$ all $\mu_{ab}$ are just periodic entire functions without cuts.
For power-like asymptotics of $\mu_{ab}$ like in \eq{eq:muasymptotics} the only possibility is that they are all constants.
However, we found that in this case there is only a trivial solution, i.e. $\bP_a$ can only be zero.
The reason for this is that for physical states $S$ must be integer and thus cannot be arbitrarily small, nevertheless, it is a sensible
 question how to define an analytical continuation from integer values of $S$.\footnote{Restricting the large positive $S$ behavior
 one can achieve uniqueness of the continuation.}

Thus we have to relax the requirement of power-like behavior at infinity. The first possibility is
to allow for $e^{2\pi u}$ asymptotics at $u\to +\infty$.
We should, however, remember about the constraints \eq{constraint} and \eq{Pmulast} which restrict our choice and the fact that we can also use $\gamma$-symmetry.
Let us show that by allowing $\mu_{24}$ to have exponential behavior and setting it to
$\mu_{24}=C\sinh(2\pi u)$ we arrive to the correct result. We analyze the reason for this choice in detail in section~\ref{sec:ancont}.

To simplify the constant part of $\mu_{ab}$ let us now make use of the $\gamma$-transformation, described in section \ref{sec:Symmetries}.
This allows us to set $\mu_{12}=1,\;\mu_{34}=0$ and the constant $C$ to $1$ then the constraint
\eq{constraint} imposes $\mu_{13}=0$ and $\mu_{14}=-1$.

Having fixed all $\mu$'s at leading order we get the following system of equations for $\bP_a$:
\beqa
&&\tilde \bP_1= -\bP_3 +\bP_1, \label{eq:P1L2} \\
&&\tilde \bP_2= -\bP_4 -\bP_2 -\bP_1 \sinh(2\pi u), \label{eq:P2L2}\\
&&\tilde \bP_3= \hspace{10mm}-\bP_3,\hspace{16mm} \label{eq:P3L2} \\
&&\tilde \bP_4= \hspace{10mm}+\bP_4+\bP_3 \sinh(2\pi u).\label{eq:P4L2}
\eeqa
Recalling that the functions $\bP_a$ only have a single short cut, we see from these equations that $\tilde{\bP}_a$ also have only this cut! This means that we can take all $\bP_a$ to be infinite Laurent series in the Zhukovsky variable $x(u)$, which rationalizes the Riemann surface with two sheets and one cut. It is defined as
\beq
	x+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{u}{g}
\eeq
where we pick the solution with a short cut, i.e.
\beq
x(u)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{u}{g}+\sqrt{\frac{u}{g}-2}\;\sqrt{\frac{u}{g}+2}\;\right)\;\;.\;\;
\eeq
Solving the equations \eqref{eq:P2L2} and \eqref{eq:P3L2} with the asymptotics \eqref{eq:asymptotics} we uniquely fix $\bP_1=\epsilon x^{-J/2}$ and $\bP_3=\epsilon\(x^{-J/2}-x^{+J/2}\)$, where $\epsilon$ is a constant yet to be fixed; we expect it to be proportional to $\sqrt{S}$.
Thus the equations \eqref{eq:P2L2} and \eqref{eq:P4L2} become
\beqa
\label{eq:P2eq}
\tilde \bP_2+\bP_2&=& -\bP_4 -\epsilon x^{-J/2}\sinh(2\pi u)\;, \\
\label{eq:P4eq}
\tilde \bP_4-\bP_4&=& \epsilon(x^{-J/2}-x^{+J/2}) \sinh(2\pi u)\;.
\eeqa
We will first solve the second equation.
It is useful to introduce operations $[f(x)]_+$ and $[f(x)]_-$, which take parts of Laurent series with positive and negative powers of $x$ respectively.  Taking into account that
\beq
	\sinh(2\pi u)=\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}I_{2n+1}  x^{2n+1},
\eeq
where $I_k\equiv I_{k}(4 \pi g)$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind, we can write $\sinh(2\pi u)$ as

 \beq
 \sinh(2\pi u)= \sinh_++\sinh_-,
 \eeq
 where explicitly
 \beqa
&& \sinh_+=[\sinh(2\pi u)]_+=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty I_{2n-1}x^{2n-1} \\
\label{defshm}
&& \sinh_-=[\sinh(2\pi u)]_-=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty I_{2n-1}x^{-2n+1}\;.
 \eeqa
We now take the following ansatz for $\bP_4$
\beq
\bP_4=\epsilon(x^{J/2}-x^{-J/2})\sinh_-+Q_{J/2-1}(u),
\eeq
where $Q_{J/2-1}$ is a polynomial of degree $J/2-1$ in $u$. It is easy to see that this ansatz solves \eqref{eq:P4eq} and has correct asymptotics. The polynomial $Q_{J/2-1}$ can be fixed from the equation \eqref{eq:P2eq} for $\bP_2$. Indeed, from the asymptotics of $\bP_2$ we see that the lhs of \eqref{eq:P2eq} does not have powers of $x$ from $-J/2+1$ to $J/2-1$. This fixes
\beq
Q_{J/2-1}(x)=-\epsilon\sum\limits_{k=1}^{J/2}I_{2k-1}\(x^{\frac{J}{2}-2k+1}+x^{-\frac{J}{2}+2k-1}\).
\eeq
Once $Q_{J/2-1}$ is found, we set $\bP_2$ to be the part of the right hand side of \eqref{eq:P2eq} with powers of $x$ less than $-J/2$, which gives
\beq
\bP_2=-\epsilon x^{+J/2} \sum_{n=\frac{J}{2}+1}^\infty I_{2n-1}x^{1-2n}.
\eeq
This completes the solution for even $J$, we summarize it below:
\beqa
\label{eq:musolLOevenL}
&&\mu_{12}=1,\ \mu_{13}=0,\ \mu_{14}=-1,\ \mu_{24}=\sinh(2\pi u),\ \mu_{34}=0,\\
\label{eq:P1solLOevenL}
&&\bP_1=\epsilon x^{-J/2}\\
\label{eq:P2solLOevenL}
&&\bP_2=-\epsilon x^{+J/2} \sum_{n={J/2}+1}^\infty I_{2n-1}x^{1-2n}\\
\label{eq:P3solLOevenL}
&&\bP_3=\epsilon \(x^{-J/2}-x^{+J/2}\)\\
\label{eq:P4solLOevenL}
&&
	\bP_4=\epsilon \(x^{J/2}-x^{-J/2}\)\sinh_- -\epsilon \sum\limits_{n=1}^{J/2}I_{2n-1}\(x^{\frac{J}{2}-2n+1}+x^{-\frac{J}{2}+2n-1}\)\;.
\label{solutionevenL}
\eeqa
In the next section we fix the remaining parameter $\epsilon$ of the solution in terms of $S$ and find the energy, but now
let us briefly discuss the solution for odd $J$. As we mentioned above the main difference is that the functions $\bP_a$ now have a branch point at $u=\infty$, which is dictated by the asymptotics \eq{eq:asymptotics}. In addition, the parity of $\mu_{ab}$ is different according to the asymptotics of these functions \eq{eq:muasymptotics}. The solution is still very similar to the even $J$ case, and we discuss it in detail in Appendix \ref{sec:oddL}. Let us present the result here:
\beq
	\mu_{12}=1,\ \mu_{13}=0,\ \mu_{14}=0,\  \mu_{24}=\cosh(2\pi u),\ \mu_{34}=1
\eeq
\beqa
\label{P1oddL}
&&   \bP_1=\epsilon  x^{-J/2}, \\
&&   \bP_2=-\epsilon  x^{J/2}\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{-\frac{J+1}{2}}I_{2k}x^{2k},\\
&&   \bP_3=-\epsilon  x^{J/2}, \\
\label{P4oddL}
&&    \bP_4=\epsilon  x^{-J/2}\cosh_--\epsilon  x^{-J/2}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\frac{J-1}{2}}I_{2k}x^{2k}-\epsilon  I_0 x^{-J/2}.
\eeqa
Note that now $\bP_a$ include half-integer powers of $x$.



\paragraph{Fixing the global charges of the solution.}
\label{sec:LOresultevenL}
Finally, to fix our solution completely we
have to find the value of $\epsilon$ and find the energy in terms of the spin using \eqref{AA1} and \eq{AA2}.
 For this we first extract the coefficients $A_a$ of the leading terms for all $\bP_a$ (see the asymptotics \eqref{eq:asymptotics}).
From \eqref{eq:P1solLOevenL}-\eqref{eq:P4solLOevenL} or \eq{P1oddL}-\eq{P4oddL}
we get
\beqa
\label{Aexp1}
&& A_1= g^{J/2} \epsilon , \\
&& A_2=-g^{J/2+1} \epsilon  I_{J+1}, \\
\label{eq:A3LOL3}
&& A_3=-g^{-J/2} \epsilon , \\
\label{Aexplast}
&& A_4=-g^{-J/2+1}\epsilon  I_{J-1}.
\eeqa
Expanding \eq{AA1}, \eq{AA2} at small $S$ with $\Delta=J+S+\gamma$, where $\gamma={\cal O}(S)$, we find at linear order
\beqa
&& \gamma=i(A_1 A_4-A_2 A_3) \\
&& S=i(A_1A_4+A_2A_3)\;.
\eeqa
Plugging in the coefficients \eq{Aexp1}-\eq{Aexplast} we find that
\beq
\label{epss}
	\epsilon=\sqrt{\frac{2\pi i S}{JI_J(\sqrt\lambda)}}
\eeq
and we obtain the anomalous dimension at leading order,
\beq
\gamma=\frac{\sqrt{\lambda}I_{J+1}(\sqrt{\lambda})}{JI_J(\sqrt{\lambda})}S+{\cal O}(S^2),
\label{eq:resultLO}
\eeq
which is precisely the slope function of Basso \cite{Basso:2011rs}.

While the above discussion concerned the ground state, i.e. the $sl(2)$ sector operator with the lowest anomalous dimension at given twist $J$, it can be
generalized for higher mode numbers. In the asymptotic Bethe ansatz for such operators we have two symmetric cuts formed by Bethe roots, with corresponding mode numbers being $\pm n$ (for the ground state $n=1$). To describe these operators within the $\bP\mu$-system
we found that we should take $\mu_{24}=C\sinh(2\pi n u)$ instead of $\mu_{24}=C\sinh(2\pi u)$ (and for odd $J$ we similarly use $\mu_{24}=C\cosh(2\pi n u)$ instead of $\mu_{24}=C\cosh(2\pi u)$). Then the solution is very similar to the one above, and we find
\beq
\gamma=\frac{n\sqrt{\lambda}I_{J+1}(n\sqrt{\lambda})}{JI_J(n\sqrt{\lambda})}S\;,
\label{slopen}
\eeq
which reproduced the result of \cite{Basso:2011rs} for  non-trivial mode number $n$. In Appendix \ref{sec:Sanyn} we also show how using the $\bP\mu$-system one can reproduce the slope function for a configuration of Bethe roots with arbitrary mode numbers and filling fractions.

In summary, we have shown how the $\bP\mu$-system correctly computes  the energy at linear order in $S$. In section \ref{sec:exact_slope_to_slope} we will compute the next, $S^2$ term in the anomalous dimension.



\subsection{The curvature function}


In this section we use the $\bP\mu$-system to compute the $S^2$ correction to the anomalous dimension, which we call the curvature function $\gamma^{(2)}(g)$. First we will discuss the case $J=2$ in detail and then describe the modifications of the solution for the cases $J=3$ and $J=4$, more details on which can be found in appendix \ref{sec:NLOapp}.

\subsubsection{Iterative procedure for the small $S$ expansion of the $\bP\mu$-system}
\label{sec:SolvingPmuL2}

For convenience let us repeat the leading order solution of the $\bP\mu$-system for $J=2$ (see \eqref{eq:musolLOevenL}-\eqref{eq:P4solLOevenL})
\beqa
{\bf P}^{(0)}_1=\epsilon\frac{1}{x}\;\;&,&\;\;{\bf P}^{(0)}_2=+\epsilon I_1-\epsilon x[\sinh(2\pi u)]_-\;\;,\\
{\bf P}^{(0)}_3=\epsilon\(\frac{1}{x}-x\)\;\;&,&\;\;
{\bf P}^{(0)}_4=
-2\epsilon I_1-
\epsilon \(\frac{1}{x}-x\)[\sinh(2\pi u)]_-.
\label{P10P40}
\eeqa
Here $\epsilon$ is a small parameter, proportional to $\sqrt{S}$ (see \eq{epss}), and by $\bP_a^{^{(0)}}$ we denote the $\bP_a$ functions at leading order in $\epsilon$.

The key observation is that the $\bP\mu$-system can be solved iteratively order by order in $\epsilon$. Let us write $\bP_a$ and $\mu_{ab}$ as an expansion in this small parameter:
\beq
	\bP_a=\epsilon\bP_a^{(0)}+\epsilon^3\bP_a^{(1)}+\epsilon^5\bP_a^{(2)}+\dots
\eeq
\beq
	\mu_{ab}=\mu_{ab}^{(0)}+\epsilon^2\mu_{ab}^{(1)}+\epsilon^4\mu_{ab}^{(2)}+\dots \;.
\eeq
This structure of the expansion is dictated by the equations \eq{eq:Pmu}, \eq{eq:mudisc} of the $\bP\mu$-system (as we will soon see explicitly). Since the leading order $\bP_a$ are of order $\epsilon$, equation \eqref{eq:mudisc} implies that the discontinuity of $\mu_{ab}$ on the cut is of order $\epsilon^2$. Thus to find $\mu_{ab}$ in the next to leading order (NLO) we only need the functions $\bP_a$ at leading order. After this, we can find the NLO correction to $\P_a$ from equations \eqref{eq:mudisc}. This will be done below, and having thus the full solution of the $\bP\mu$-system at NLO we will find the energy at order $S^2$.

\subsubsection{Correcting $\mu_{ab}$\dots}
\label{sec:muNLOL2}
In this subsection we find the NLO corrections $\mu^{(1)}_{ab}$ to $\mu_{ab}$. As follows from \eqref{eq:mudisc} and \eq{muper},
they should satisfy the equation
\beq
 \mu_{ab}^{(1)}(u+i)-\mu_{ab}^{(1)}(u)=\bP_a^{(0)} \tilde\bP_b^{(0)}-  \bP_b^{(0)} \tilde\bP_a^{(0)},
\label{eq:mudiscNLO}
\eeq
in which the right hand is known explicitly. For that reason let us define an apparatus for solving equations of this type, i.e.
\beq
f(u+i)-f(u)=h(u).
\label{eqperiod}
\eeq
More precisely, we consider functions $f(u)$ and $h(u)$ with one cut in $u$ between $-2g$ and $2g$, and no poles. Such functions can be represented as infinite Laurent series in the Zhukovsky variable $x(u)$, and we additionally restrict ourselves to the case where for $h(u)$ this expansion does not have a constant term\footnote{The r.h.s. of \eq{eq:mudiscNLO} has the form $F(u)-\tilde F(u)$ and therefore indeed does not have a constant term in its expansion, as the constant in $F$ would cancel in the difference $F(u)-\tilde F(u)$.}.

One can see that the general solution of \eqref{eqperiod} has a form of a particular solution plus an arbitrary $i$-periodic function, which we also call a zero mode. % The class of $i$-periodic function we consider here is restricted to $\sinh(2\pi u)$, $\cosh(2\pi u)$ and constants (for discussion of higher modes $\sinh(2\pi n u), \cosh(2\pi n u)$ see appendix \ref{sec:appHigher}).
 First we will describe the construction of the particular solution and later deal with zero modes. The linear operator which gives the particular solution of \eqref{eqperiod} described below will be denoted as $\Sigma$.

Notice that given the explicit form \eqref{P10P40} of $\bP^{(0)}_a$, the right hand side of \eqref{eq:mudiscNLO} can be represented in a form
\beq
\alpha(x)\sinh(2\pi u)+\beta(x),
\label{alphabetasinh}
\eeq
 where $\alpha(x),\beta(x)$ are power series in $x$  growing at infinity not faster than polynomially. Thus for such $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we define
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\[\alpha(x)\sinh(2\pi u)+\beta(x)\]\equiv \sinh(2\pi u) \Sigma\cdot \alpha(x)+\Sigma\cdot \beta(x).
\eeq
We also define $\Sigma\cdot x^{-n}=\Gamma'\cdot x^{-n}$ for $n>0$, where the integral operator $\Gamma'$ defined as
\beq
\(\Gamma'\cdot h\)(u)\equiv \oint_{-2g}^{2g}\frac{dv}{{4\pi i}}\partial_u \log \frac{\Gamma[i (u-v)+1]}{\Gamma[-i (u-v)]}h(v).
\label{Gammaprime}
\eeq
This requirement is consistent because of the following relation \footnote{We remind that $f_+$ and $f_-$ stand for the part of the Laurent expansion with, respectively, positive and negative powers of $x$, while $\tilde f$ is the analytic continuation around the branch point at $u=2g$ (which amounts to replacing $x\to\frac{1}{x}$)}
\beq
\(\Gamma'\cdot h\)(u+i)-\(\Gamma'\cdot h\)(u)
=
-\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{-2g}^{2g}\frac{h(v)}{u-v}dv=h_-(u)-\widetilde{h_+}(u).
\label{eq:Gammaproperty}
\eeq
What is left is to define $\Sigma$ on positive powers of $x$. We do it by requiring
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\left[x^a+1/x^a\right]\equiv p_a'(u) %=2 \Sigma\cdot\left[T_a\(\frac{u}{2g}\)\right],
\label{paprime}
\eeq
where $p_a'(u)$ is a polynomial in $u$ of degree $a+1$, which is a solution of
\beq
p_a'(u+i)-p_a'(u)=\frac{1}{2}\(x^a+1/x^a\)
\eeq
and satisfies the following additional properties: $p_a'(0)=0$ for odd $a$  and $p_a'(i/2)=0$ for even $a$. One can check that this definition is consistent and defines of $p'_a(u)$ uniquely. Explicit form of the first few $p_a'(u)$, which we call periodized  Chebyshev polynomials, can be found in appendix \ref{sec:appPeriodized}.
%where $T_a(u)$ are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.

From this definition of $\Sigma$ one can see that the result of its action on expressions of the form \eqref{alphabetasinh}
can again be represented in this form - what is important for us is that no exponential functions other than $\sinh(2\pi u)$ appear in the result.

A good illustration of how the definitions above work would be the following two simple examples. Suppose one wants to calculate $\Sigma\cdot\(x-\frac{1}{x}\)$, then it is convenient to split the argument of $\Sigma$ in the following way:
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\(x-\frac{1}{x}\)=\Sigma\cdot\(x+\frac{1}{x}\)-2\Sigma\cdot\frac{1}{x}.
\eeq
In the first term we recognize $p_1'(u)=\frac{i u(u-i)}{2g}$, whereas in the second the argument of $\Sigma$ is decaying at infinity, thus $\Sigma$ is equivalent to $\Gamma'$ in this context. Notice also that $\Gamma'\cdot \frac{1}{x}=-\Gamma'\cdot x$. All together, we get
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\(x-\frac{1}{x}\)=\Sigma\cdot\(x+\frac{1}{x}\)-2\Sigma\cdot\frac{1}{x}=2p_1'(u)+ 2\Gamma'\cdot x
\eeq

In a similar way, in order to calculate $\Sigma\cdot\frac{\sinh_--\sinh_+}{2}$, one can write $\frac{\sinh_--\sinh_+}{2}=\sinh_--\frac{1}{2}\sinh(2\pi u)$.
Notice that since $\sinh_-$ decays at infinity,
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\sinh_-=\Gamma'\cdot\sinh_-.
\eeq
 Also, since $i$-periodic functions can be factored out of $\Sigma$,
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\sinh(2\pi u)=\sinh(2\pi u)\Sigma\cdot 1=\sinh(2\pi u)p_0'(u)/2.
\eeq
 Finally,
\beq
\Sigma\cdot\frac{\sinh_--\sinh_+}{2}=\Gamma'\cdot(\sinh_-)-\frac{1}{2}\sinh(2\pi u)p_0'(u).
\eeq

As an example we present the particular solution for two components of $\mu_{ab}$ (below we will argue that $\pi_{12}$ and $\pi_{13}$ can be chosen to be zero, see  \eqref{eq:periodicpart})
\beqa
\label{muexpl1}
&&\mu_{13}^{(1)}-\pi_{13}=\Sigma\cdot\({\bf P}_1 \tilde{\bf P}_3-{\bf P}_3 \tilde{\bf P}_1\)=\epsilon^2\Sigma\cdot\(x^2-\frac{1}{x^2}\)=
\epsilon^2\;\;\(\Gamma'\cdot x^2+p_2'(u)\),\\
\nonumber
&&\mu_{12}^{(1)}-\pi_{12}=\Sigma\cdot\({\bf P}_1
   \tilde{\bf P}_2-{\bf P}_2
   \tilde{\bf P}_1\)= \\&& =
   -\epsilon^2\[2 I_1\Gamma'\cdot x-\sinh(2\pi u)\;\Gamma'\cdot x^2-\Gamma'\cdot\(\sinh_-\(x^2+\frac{1}{x^2}\)\)
   \].\label{muexpl2}
\eeqa
Now let us apply $\Sigma$ defined above to \eq{eq:mudiscNLO}, writing that its general solution is
\beq
\mu^{(1)}_{ab}=\Sigma\cdot(\bP_a^{(0)} \tilde\bP_b^{(0)}-  \bP_b^{(0)} \tilde\bP_a^{(0)})+\pi_{ab},
\label{eq:sol13}
\eeq
 where the zero mode $\pi_{ab}$ is an arbitrary $i$-periodic entire function, which can be written similarly to the leading order as $c_{1,ab}\cosh{2\pi u}+c_{2,ab}\sinh{2\pi u}+c_{3,ab}$. Again, many of the coefficients $c_{i,ab}$ can be set to zero. First, the prescription from section \ref{sec:ancont} implies that non-vanishing at infinity part of coefficients of $\sinh(2\pi u)$ and $\cosh(2\pi u)$ in $\mu_{12}$ is zero. As one can see from the explicit form \eqref{muexpl2} of the particular solution which we choose for $\mu_{12}$, it does not contain $\cosh(2\pi u)$ and the coefficient of $\sinh(2\pi u)$ is decaying at infinity. So in order to satisfy the prescription, we have to set $c_{2,12}$ and $c_{2,12}$ to zero. Second, since the coefficients $c_{n,ab}$ are of order $S$, we can remove some of them by making an infinitesimal  $\gamma$-transformation, i.e. with $R=1+{\cal O}(S)$ (see section \ref{sec:Symmetries} and Eq. \eqref{gammaP}).
 Further, the Pfaffian constraint \eqref{constraint} imposes 5 equations on the remaining coefficients, which leaves the following 2-parametric family of zero modes
 \beqa
&& \pi_{12}=0,\ \pi_{13}=0,\ \pi_{14}=\frac{1}{2}c_{1,34}\cosh{2\pi u},\\
 && \pi_{24}= c_{1,24}\cosh{2\pi u},\ \pi_{34}= c_{1,34}\cosh{2\pi u}.
 \eeqa

Let us now look closer at the exponential part of $\mu_{14}$ and $\mu_{24}$. Combining the leading order \eqref{eq:musolLOevenL} and the perturbation \eqref{eq:sol13} and taking into account the fact that operator $\Sigma$ does not produce terms proportional to $\cosh{2 \pi u}$, we obtain
\beqa
&&\mu_{14}=\frac{1}{2}c_{1,34}\cosh{2\pi u}+{\cal O}(\epsilon) \sinh{2\pi u}+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)+\dots, \\
&&\mu_{24}=\frac{1}{2}c_{1,24}\cosh{2\pi u}+(1+{\cal O}(\epsilon)) \sinh{2\pi u}+\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)+\dots,
\eeqa
where dots stand for powers-like terms or exponential terms suppressed by powers of $u$.

As we remember from section \ref{sec:ancont}, only the 2nd solution of the 5th order Baxter equation \eqref{5bax} can contribute to the exponential part of $\mu_{14}$ and $\mu_{24}$, which means that $\mu_{14}$ and $\mu_{24}$ are proportional to the same linear combination of $\sinh{2\pi u}$ and $\cosh{2\pi u}$. From the second equation one can see that this linear combination can be normalized to be $\frac{1}{2}c_{1,24}\cosh{2\pi u}+(1+{\cal O}(\epsilon)) \sinh{2\pi u}$. Then $\mu_{14}=C\(\frac{1}{2}c_{1,24}\cosh{2\pi u}+(1+{\cal O}(\epsilon)) \sinh{2\pi u}\)$, where $C$ is some constant, which is of order ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$, because the coefficient of $\sinh{2\pi u}$ in the first equation is ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$. Taking into account that $c_{1,24}$ is ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$ itself, we find that $c_{1,34}=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$, i.e. it does not contribute at the order which we are considering. So the final form of the zero mode in \eqref{eq:sol13} is
\beqa
&& \pi_{12}=0,\ \pi_{13}=0,\ \pi_{14}=0,\\
 && \pi_{24}=c_{1,24}\cosh{2\pi u},\ \pi_{34}=0.
 \label{eq:periodicpart}
 \eeqa


%The result of acting with $\Sigma$ on the combination $\bP_a^{(0)} \tilde\bP_b^{(0)}$ appearing in \eq{eq:sol13} can be %rewritten in terms of $\Gamma'$ and periodized versions of Chebyshev polynomials $p_a'(u)$ defined as
%\beq
%p_a'(u)=\Sigma\cdot\left[x^a+1/x^a\right]=2 \Sigma\cdot\left[T_a\(\frac{u}{2g}\)\right],
%\label{paprime}
%\eeq
%where $T_a(u)$ are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.




In this way, using the particular solution given by $\Sigma$ and the form of zero modes \eqref{eq:periodicpart} we have computed all the functions $\mu_{ab}^{(1)}$. The details and the results of the calculation can be found in appendix \ref{sec:appmu2}.

%In appendix \ref{sec:appmu2} we give more details on the calculation and results for all $\mu_{ab}^{(1)}$.

\subsubsection{Correcting $\bP_{a}$\dots}
\label{sec:CalculationofPa}
In the previous section we found the NLO part of $\mu_{ab}$. Now, according to the iterative procedure described in section \ref{sec:SolvingPmuL2}, we can use it to write a closed system of equations for $\bP_a^{(1)}$.
Indeed, expanding the system \eqref{eq:pmuexpanded} to NLO we get
\beqa
\label{eq:P1eqNLOL2}
&&\tilde \bP^{(1)}_1
- \bP^{(1)}_1
= -\bP^{(1)}_3+r_1,  \\
\label{eq:P2eqNLOL2}
&&\tilde \bP^{(1)}_2+\bP_2^{(1)}= -\bP^{(1)}_4  -\bP^{(1)}_1 \sinh(2\pi u)+r_2, \\
\label{eq:P3eqNLOL2}
&&\tilde \bP^{(1)}_3+\bP_3^{(1)}=r_3,\\
\label{eq:P4eqNLOL2}
&&\tilde \bP^{(1)}_4-\bP_4^{(1)}=\bP_3^{(1)} \sinh(2\pi u)+r_4,
\eeqa
where the free terms are given by
\beq
r_a=-\mu_{ab}^{(1)}\chi^{bc}\bP_c^{(0)}.
\label{eq:ra}
\eeq
Notice that $r_a$ does not change if we add a matrix proportional to $\bP_a^{(0)} \tilde\bP_b^{(0)}-  \bP_b^{(0)} \tilde\bP_a^{(0)}$ to $\mu^{(1)}_{ab}$, due to the relations
\beq
	\bP_a \chi^{ab}\bP_b=0,\;\bP_a\chi^{ab}\tilde\bP_b=0,
\eeq	
which follow from the $\bP\mu$-system equations. In particular we can use this property to replace $\mu_{ab}^{(1)}$ in \eq{eq:ra} by $\mu_{ab}^{(1)}+\frac{1}{2}\(\bP_a^{(0)} \tilde\bP_b^{(0)}-  \bP_b^{(0)} \tilde\bP_a^{(0)}\)$. This will be convenient for us, since in expressions for $\mu^{(1)}_{ab}$ in terms of $p_a$ and $\Gamma$ (see \eq{muexpl1}, \eq{muexpl2} and appendix \ref{sec:appmu2}) this change amounts to simply replacing $\Gamma'$ by a convolution with a more symmetric kernel:
\beq
 \Gamma' \rightarrow  \Gamma,
\eeq
\beq
\(\Gamma\cdot h\)(u)\equiv \oint_{-2g}^{2g}\frac{dv}{{4\pi i}}\partial_u \log \frac{\Gamma[i (u-v)+1]}{\Gamma[-i (u-v)+1]}h(v),
\label{Gamma}
\eeq
while at the same time replacing
\beq
	 p_a'(u)\rightarrow  p_a(u),\ \
\eeq
\beq
	p_a(u)=p_a'(u)+\frac{1}{2}\(x^a(u)+x^{-a}(u)\).
\label{pa}
\eeq


Having made this comment, we will now develop tools for solving the equations \eq{eq:P1eqNLOL2} - \eq{eq:P4eqNLOL2}.
Notice first that if we solve them in the order \eq{eq:P3eqNLOL2}, \eq{eq:P1eqNLOL2}, \eq{eq:P4eqNLOL2}, \eq{eq:P2eqNLOL2}, substituting into each subsequent equation the solution of all the previous, then at each step the problem we have to solve has a form

\beq
 \tilde f+f=h\;\; \text{or}\;\; \tilde f-f=h\;\;,
 \label{eqs}
\eeq
  where $h$ is known, $f$ is unknown and both the right hand side and the left hand side are power series in $x$. It is obvious that equations \eqref{eqs} have solutions only for $h$ such that $h=\tilde h$ and $h=-\tilde h$ respectively.
   On the class of such $h$ a particular solution for $f$ can be written as
  \beq
  f= [h]_-+[h]_0/2\equiv H\cdot h\;\; \Rightarrow\;\; \tilde f+f=h
    \label{solfh1}
  \eeq
  and
    \beq
    f= [h]_-\equiv K\cdot h\;\; \Rightarrow\;\; \tilde f-f=h,
  \label{solfh2}
  \eeq
  where $[h]_0$ is the constant part of Laurent expansion of $h$ (it does not appear in the second equation, because $h$ such that $h=-\tilde h$ does not have a constant part).
  The operators $K$ and $H$ introduced here can be also defined by their integral kernels
\beqa
H(u,v)&=&-\frac{1}{4\pi i}\frac{\sqrt{u-2g}\sqrt{u+2g}}{\sqrt{v-2g}\sqrt{v+2g}}\frac{1}{u-v}dv, \\
K(u,v)&=&+\frac{1}{4\pi i}\frac{1}{u-v}dv.
\label{eq:HK}
\eeqa
which are equivalent to \eqref{solfh1},\eqref{solfh2} of the classes of $h$ such that $h=\tilde h$ and $h=-\tilde h$ respectively\footnote{We denote e.g. $K\cdot h=\oint_{-2g}^{2g}K(u,v)h(v)dv$ where the integral is around the branch cut between $-2g$ and $2g$.}. The particular solution $f=K\cdot h$ of the equation $\tilde f+ f=h$ is unique in the class of functions $f$ decaying at infinity, and the solution $f=H \cdot h$ of $\tilde f- f=h$ is unique for non-growing $f$. In all other cases the general solution will include zero modes, which, in our case are fixed by asymptotics of $\bP_a$.


Now it is easy to write the explicit solution of the equations
\eq{eq:P1eqNLOL2}-\eq{eq:P4eqNLOL2}:
\beqa
\bP_3^{(1)}&=&H\cdot r_3,\\
\bP_1^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\P^{(1)}_3+K\cdot \(r_1-\frac{1}{2} r_3\),\\
\bP_4^{(1)}&=&K\cdot\(-\frac{1}{2}\(\tilde\bP_3^{(1)}-\bP_3^{(1)}\) \sinh(2\pi u)+
\frac{2r_4+r_3 \sinh(2\pi u)}{2}\)-2\delta,\\
\bP_2^{(1)}&=&H\cdot\(-\frac{1}{2}
\(
{\bf P}^{(1)}_4+\sinh(2\pi u){\bf P}^{(1)}_1+\tilde{\bf P}^{(1)}_4+\sinh(2\pi u)\tilde{\bf P}^{(1)}_1
\)+\right.\\ \nn
&&\left.
+\frac{r_4+\sinh(2\pi u) r_1+2r_2}{2}\)+\delta,
\label{eq:P4solNLOL2}
\eeqa
where $\delta$ is a constant fixed uniquely by requiring $\mathcal{O}(1/u^2)$ asymptotics for $\bP_2$. This asymptotic also sets the last coefficient $c_{1,24}$ left in $\pi_{12}$ to zero. Thus in the class of functions with asymptotics \eqref{eq:asymptotics} the solution for $\mu_{ab}$ and $\bP_a$ is unique up to a $\gamma$-transformation.




\subsubsection{Result for $J=2$}
\label{sec:resultL2}

In order to obtain the result for the anomalous dimension, we again use the formulas \eq{AA1}, \eq{AA2} which connect the leading coefficients of $\bP_a$ with $\Delta,\ J\ $ and $S$. After plugging in $A_i$ which we find from our solution, we obtain the result for the $S^2$ correction to the anomalous dimension:
\beqa
\label{gamma2L2}
\gamma^{(2)}_{J=2}&=&\frac{\pi}{g^2(I_1-I_3)^3}\oint \frac{du_x}{2\pi i}\oint \frac{du_y}{2\pi i}\[\frac{8  I_1^2(I_1+I_3) \left(x^3-\left(x^2+1\right) y\right) }{ \left(x^3-x\right) y^2}\right.\\ \nn
&&   +\frac{8  \sh_-^x \sh_-^y

\eeqa
Here the integration contour goes around the branch cut at $(-2g,2g)$. We also denote
$\sh_-^x=\sinh_-(x) ,\ \sh_-^y=\sinh_-(y) $ (recall that $\sinh_-$ was defined in \eq{defshm}). This is our final result for the curvature function at any coupling.


It is interesting to note that our result contains the combination $\log\frac{\Gamma (i u_x-i u_y+1)}{\Gamma (1-i u_x+i u_y)}$ which plays an essential role in the construction of the BES dressing phase. We will use this identification in section \ref{sec:Konishidimension} to compute the integral in \eq{gamma2L2} numerically with high precision.

In the next subsections we will describe generalizations of the $J=2$ result to operators with $J=3$ and $J=4$.

 \subsubsection{Results for higher $J$}
\label{sec:SolvingPmuL3}


Solving the $\bP\mu$-system for $J=3$ is similar to the $J=2$ case described above, except for several technical complications, which we will describe here, leaving the details for the appendix \ref{sec:appnlo3}.
As in the previous section, the starting point is the LO solution of the $\bP\mu$ system, which for $J=3$ reads
\beq
	\bP_1=\epsilon x^{-3/2},\ \bP_3=-\epsilon x^{3/2},
\label{P1P3LOsolL3}
\eeq
\beq
	\bP_2=-\epsilon x^{3/2}\cosh_- +\epsilon x^{-1/2}I_2,
\label{P2LOsolL3}
\eeq
\beq
	\bP_4=-\epsilon x^{1/2}I_2-\epsilon x^{-3/2}I_0-\epsilon x^{-3/2}\cosh_-,
\label{P4LOsolL3}
\eeq
\beq
	\mu_{12}=1,\ \mu_{13}=0,\ \mu_{14}=0,\  \mu_{24}=\cosh(2\pi u),\ \mu_{34}=1\;.
\eeq
The first step is to construct $\mu^{(1)}_{ab}$ from its discontinuity given by the equation \eqref{eq:mudiscNLO}. The full solution consists of a particular solution and a general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, i.e. zero mode $\pi_{ab}$. In our case the zero mode can be an $i$-periodic function, i.e. a linear combination of $\sinh(2\pi u)$, $\cosh(2\pi u)$ and constants. As in the case of $J=2$, we use a combination of the Pfaffian constraint, prescription from section \ref{sec:ancont} and a $\gamma$-transformation to reduce all the parameters of the zero mode to just one, sitting in $\mu_{24}$:
 \beq
\pi_{12}=0,\;\pi_{13}=0,\;\pi_{14}=0,\;\pi_{24}=c_{24,2} \sinh\(2\pi u\),\;\pi_{34}=0.
\label{eq:periodicpartL3}
\eeq

As in the previous section, the next step is to find $\bP_a^{(1)}$ from the $P\mu$ system expanded to the first order, namely from
\beqa
\label{P1L3}
&&\tilde \bP_1^{(1)}+\bP_3^{(1)}=r_1,\\
&&\tilde \bP_2^{(1)}+\bP_4^{(1)}+\bP_1^{(1)} \cosh(2\pi u)=r_2,\\
&&\tilde \bP_3^{(1)}+\bP_1^{(1)}=r_3,\\
&&\tilde \bP_4^{(1)}+\bP_2^{(1)}-\bP_3^{(1)}\cosh(2\pi u)=r_4,
\label{P4L3}
\eeqa
where $r_a$ are defined by \eqref{eq:ra} and for $J=3$ are given explicitly in appendix \ref{sec:appnlo3}.
In attempt to solve this system, however, we encounter another technical complication. As one can see from \eqref{P1P3LOsolL3}-\eqref{P4LOsolL3}, the LO solution contains half-integer powers of $J$, meaning that the $\bP_a$ now have an extra branch point at infinity.
However, the operations $H$ and $K$ defined by \eq{eq:HK} work only for functions which have Laurent expansion in integer powers of $x$. In order to solve equations of the type \eq{eq:mudiscNLO} on the class of functions which allow Laurent-like expansion in $x$ with only half-integer powers $x$, we introduce operations $H^*,K^*$:
\beqa
&&H^*\cdot f\equiv\frac{x+1}{\sqrt{x}}H\cdot\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x+1} f, \\
&&K^*\cdot f\equiv\frac{x+1}{\sqrt{x}}K\cdot\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x+1} f.
\eeqa
In terms of these operations the solution of the system \eqref{P1L3}-\eqref{P4L3} is
\beqa
\label{P1J3}
\bP_{1}^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\(H^*(r_1+r_3)+ K^*(r_1-r_3)\)+\bP_1^{\text{zm}},\\
\bP_{3}^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\(H^*(r_1+r_3)- K^*(r_1-r_3)\)+\bP_2^{\text{zm}},\\
\bP_{2}^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\(H^*(r_2+r_4)+ K^*(r_2-r_4)-\right.\nonumber\\
&-&\left.H^*\(\cosh(2\pi u)K^*(r_1-r_3)\)- K^*\(\cosh(2\pi u)H^*(r_1+r_3)\)\right)+\bP_3^{\text{zm}},\\
\label{P4J3}
\bP_{4}^{(1)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\(H^*(r_2+r_4)- K^*(r_2-r_4)-\right.\nonumber\\
&-&\left.H^*\(\cosh(2\pi u)K^*(r_1-r_3)\)+ K^*\(\cosh(2\pi u)H^*(r_1+r_3)\)\right)+\bP_4^{\text{zm}},
\eeqa
where $\bP_a^{\text{zm}}$ is a solution of the system \eq{P1L3}-\eq{P4L3} with right hand side set to zero, whose explicit form $\bP_a^{\text{zm}}$ is given in Appendix \ref{sec:appnlo3} (see \eqref{P1J3zm}-\eqref{P4J3zm}) and which is parametrized by four constants $L_1,L_2,L_3,L_4$, e.g.
\beqa
\bP_1^{\text{zm}}=L_1 x^{-1/2}+L_3x^{1/2}.
\eeqa
These constants are fixed by requiring correct asymptotics of $\bP_a$, which also fixes the parameter $c_{24,2}$ in the zero mode \eq{eq:periodicpartL3} of $\mu_{ab}$ \footnote{Actually in this way $c_{24,2}$ is fixed to be zero.}. Indeed, a priori $\bP_2$ and $\bP_1$ have wrong asymptotics. Imposing a constraint that $\bP_2$ decays as $u^{-5/2}$ and $\bP_1$ decays as $u^{-3/2}$ produces five equations, which fix all the parameters uniquely.



Skipping the details of the intermediate calculations, we present the final result for the anomalous dimension:
\beqa
\label{gamma2L3}
&&\gamma^{(2)}_{J=3}=\oint \frac{du_x}{2\pi i}\oint \frac{du_y}{2\pi i}
i \frac{1}{g^2(I_2-I_4)^3} \left[\frac{2 \left(x^6-1\right) y (\ch_-^y)^2 (I_2-I_4)}{x^3 \left(y^2-1\right)}-\right.\\ \nn
&&-\frac{4 \ch_-^x
   \ch_-^y \left(x^3 y^3-1\right) \left(I_2 x^5 y^3+I_2-I_4 x^2 \left(x y^3+1\right)\right)}{x^3
   \left(x^2-1\right) y^3}+\\ \nn
&& +\frac{(y^2-1)  (\ch_-^y)^2 I_2 \left( (x^8+1) \left(2 y^4+3 y^2+2\right)-(x^6+x^2)
   \left(y^2+1\right)^2\right)}{x^3 \left(x^2-1\right) y^3}-
   \\ \nn
   && -\frac{(y^2-1)  (\ch_-^y)^2 I_4 \left((x^8+1) y^2+(x^6+x^2) \left(y^4+1\right)\right)}{x^3 \left(x^2-1\right) y^3}-
   \\ \nn
&&-\frac{4 I_2 \ch_-^y (x-y) (x y-1) \left(I_2
   \left(\(x^6+1\) \left(y^3+y\right)+\(x^5+x\) \left(y^4+y^2+1\right)-x^3 \left(y^4+1\right)\right)+I_4 x^3
   y^2\right)}{x^3 \left(x^2-1\right) y^3}-\\ \nn
&& \left.-\frac{I_2^2 (y^2-1)  (x-y) (x y-1) \left(I_2 \left(\(x^6 +x^4 +x^2 +1\)y+2 x^3
   \left(y^2+1\right)\right)+I_4 \left(x^5+x\right) \left(y^2+1\right)\right)}{x^3 \left(x^2-1\right) y^3}\right]\\ \nn
	&& \frac{1}{4\pi i}\partial_u \log\frac{\Gamma (i u_x-i u_y+1)}{\Gamma (1-i u_x+i u_y)}.
\eeqa
We defined $\ch_-^x=\cosh_-(x)$ and $\ch_-^y=\cosh_-(y)$, where $\cosh_-(x)$ is the part of the Laurent expansion of $\cosh\(g(x+1/x)\)$ vanishing at infinity, i.e.
\beq
\cosh_-(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} I_{2k}x^{-2k}.
\eeq
The result for $J=4$ is given in appendix \ref{sec:SolvingPmuL4}.


\subsubsection{Weak coupling expansion}



Our results for the curvature function $\gamma^{(2)}(g)$ at $J=2,3,4$ (Eqs. \eq{gamma2L2}, \eq{gamma2L3}, \eq{gamma2L4}) are straightforward to expand at weak coupling. We give expansions to 10 loops in \text{appendix \ref{sec:weakS3}}. Let us start with the $J=2$ case, for which we found
\beqa
\label{weak22}
\gamma_{J=2}^{(2)}&=&-8 g^2 \zeta_3+g^4 \left(140 \zeta_5-\frac{32 \pi ^2 \zeta_3}{3}\right)+g^6 \left(200 \pi ^2 \zeta_5-2016
   \zeta_7\right)
	\\ \nn
	&+&g^8 \left(-\frac{16 \pi ^6 \zeta_3}{45}-\frac{88 \pi ^4 \zeta_5}{9}-\frac{9296 \pi ^2 \zeta_7}{3}+27720 \zeta_9\right)
	\\ \nn
	&+&g^{10} \left(\frac{208 \pi ^8 \zeta_3}{405}+\frac{160 \pi ^6 \zeta_5}{27}+144
   \pi ^4 \zeta_7+45440 \pi ^2 \zeta_9-377520 \zeta_{11}\right)
	+\dots
\eeqa
Remarkably, at each loop order all contributions have the same transcendentality, and only simple zeta values (i.e. $\zeta_n$) appear. This is also true for the $J=3$ and $J=4$ cases.

We can check this expansion against known results, as the anomalous dimensions of twist two operators have been computed up to five loops for arbitrary spin \cite{Kotikov:2001sc,Kotikov:2003fb,Kotikov:2004er,Moch:2004pa,Staudacher:2004tk,Kotikov:2007cy,Bajnok:2008qj,Lukowski:2009ce} (see also \cite{Velizhanin:2013vla} and the review \cite{Freyhult:2010kc}).
To three loops they can be found solely from the ABA equations, while at four and five loops wrapping corrections need to be taken into account which was done in \cite{Bajnok:2008qj,Lukowski:2009ce} by utilizing generalized Luscher formulas. All these results are given by linear combinations of harmonic sums
\beq
	S_a(N) = \sum_{n=1}^N\frac{(\mathrm{sign}(a))^n}{n^{|a|}}, \ \
	S_{a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots}(N)=\sum_{n=1}^N\frac{(\mathrm{sign}(a_1))^n}{n^{|a_1|}}S_{a_2,a_3,\dots}(n)
\eeq
with argument equal to the spin $S$. To make a comparison with our results we expanded these predictions in the $S\to 0$ limit. For this lengthy computation, as well as to simplify the final expressions, we used the \verb"Mathematica" packages HPL \cite{HPL}, the package \cite{VolinPackage} provided with the paper \cite{Leurent:2013mr}, and the HarmonicSums package \cite{Ablinger}.

In this way we have confirmed the coefficients in \eq{weak22} to four loops. Let us note that expansion of harmonic sums leads to multiple zeta values (MZVs), which however cancel in the final result leaving only $\zeta_n$.

Importantly, the part of the four-loop coefficient which comes from the wrapping correction is essential for matching with our result. This is a strong confirmation that our calculation based on the $\bP\mu$-system is valid beyond the ABA level. Additional evidence that our result incorporates all finite-size effects is found at strong coupling (see section \ref{sec:SlopeSlopeStrongCoupling}).




	
	
For operators with $J=3$, our prediction at weak coupling is
\beqa
	\gamma_{J=3}^{(2)}&=&-2g^2\zeta_3+g^4\(12 \zeta_5-\frac{4 \pi ^2 \zeta_3}{3}\)
	+g^6\(\frac{2 \pi ^4 \zeta_3}{45}+8 \pi ^2 \zeta_5-28
   \zeta_7\)\\ \nn
   &+&
   g^8\(-\frac{4 \pi ^6 \zeta_3}{45}-\frac{4 \pi ^4 \zeta_5}{15}-528 \zeta_9\)
   +\dots
\eeqa
The known results for any spin in this case are available at up to six loops, including the wrapping correction which first appears at five loops \cite{Beccaria:2007cn,Beccaria:2009eq,Velizhanin:2010cm}. Expanding them at $S\to 0$ we have checked our calculation to four loops.\footnote{As a further check it would be interesting to expand to order $S^2$ the known results for twist 2 operators at five loops, and for twist 3 operators at five and six loops -- all of which are given by huge expressions.}


For future reference, in appendix \ref{sec:weakS3} we present an expansion of known results for $J=2,3$ up to order $S^3$ at first several loop orders. In particular, we found that multiple zeta values appear in this expansion, which did not happen at lower orders in $S$.

Let us now discuss the $J=4$ case. The expansion of our result reads:
\beqa
\label{gamma42weak}
	\gamma_{J=4}^{(2)}&=&g^2 \left(-\frac{14 \zeta_3}{5}+\frac{48 \zeta_5}{\pi ^2}-\frac{252 \zeta_7}{\pi
   ^4}\right)	\\ \nn
	&+&g^4 \left(-\frac{22 \pi ^2 \zeta_3}{25}+\frac{474 \zeta_5}{5}-\frac{8568 \zeta_7}{5 \pi
   ^2}+\frac{8316 \zeta_9}{\pi ^4}\right)\\ \nn
	&+&g^6 \left(\frac{32 \pi ^4 \zeta_3}{875}+\frac{3656 \pi ^2 \zeta_5}{175}-\frac{56568 \zeta_7}{25}+\frac{196128 \zeta_9}{5 \pi ^2}-\frac{185328 \zeta_{11}}{\pi ^4}\right)	\\ \nn
	&+&g^8 \left(-\frac{4 \pi ^6 \zeta_3}{175}-\frac{68 \pi ^4 \zeta_5}{75}-\frac{55312 \pi ^2 \zeta_7}{125}+\frac{1113396 \zeta_9}{25}-\frac{3763188 \zeta_{11}}{5 \pi ^2}\right.
	\\ \nn
	 && \ \ \ \ \ \  + \left.\frac{3513510 \zeta_{13}}{\pi ^4} \right)+\dots
\eeqa
Unlike for the $J=2$ and $J=3$ cases, we could not find a closed expression for the energy at any spin $S$ in literature even at one loop, however there is another way to check our result. One can expand the asymptotic Bethe ansatz equations at large $J$ for fixed values of $S=2,4,6,\dots$ and then extract the coefficients in the expansion which are polynomial in $S$. This was done in \cite{Beccaria:2012kp} (see appendix C there) where at one loop the expansion was found up to order $1/J^6$:
\beqa
\label{gammaJ}
\nn
	\gamma(S,J) &=& g^2\(\frac{S}{2\,J^{2}}-\Big(\frac{S^{2}}{4}+\frac{S}{2}\Big)\,\frac{1}{ J^{3}}
+\Big[
\frac{3 S^3}{16}+\Big(\frac{1}{8}-\frac{\pi ^2}{12}\Big) S^2+\frac{S}{2}
\Big]\,\frac{1}{ J^{4}} +\dots\)+\mathcal{O}(g^4)
\\
\eeqa
Now taking the part proportional to $S^2$ and substituting $J=4$ one may expect to get a numerical approximation to the 1-loop coefficient in our result \eq{gamma42weak}, i.e. $-\frac{14 \zeta_3}{5}+\frac{48 \zeta_5}{\pi ^2}-\frac{252 \zeta_7}{\pi
   ^4}$. To increase the precision we extended the expansion in \eq{gammaJ} to order $1/J^8$. Remarkably, in this way we confirmed the 1-loop part of the $\bP\mu$ prediction \eq{gamma42weak} with about $1\%$ accuracy! In Fig. \ref{fig:j4plot} one can also see that the ABA result converges to our prediction when the order of expansion in $1/J$ is being increased.

Also, in contrast to $J=2$ and $J=3$ cases we see that negative powers of $\pi$ appear in \eq{gamma42weak} (although still all the contributions at a given loop order have the same transcendentality). It would be interesting to understand why this happens  from the gauge theory perspective, especially since expansion of the leading $S$ term \eq{slopeIn} has the same structure for all $J$,
\beq
	\gamma_{J}^{(1)}=\frac{8 \pi ^2 g^2}{J (J+1)}-\frac{32 \pi ^4 g^4}{J (J+1)^2
   (J+2)}+\frac{256 \pi ^6 g^6}{J (J+1)^3 (J+2) (J+3)}
	+\dots
\eeq
The change of structure at $J=4$ might be related to the fact that for $J\geq 4$ the ground state anomalous dimension even at one loop is expected to be an irrational number for integer $S>0$ (see \cite{Beccaria:2008pp}, \cite{Belitsky:2008mg}), and thus cannot be written as a linear combination of harmonic sums with integer coefficients.



In the next section we will discuss tests and applications of our results at strong coupling.



\subsubsection{Strong coupling expansion}

In this section we will present the strong coupling expansion of our results for the curvature function, and link these results to anomalous dimensions of short operators at strong coupling. We will also obtain new predictions for the BFKL pomeron intercept.

%\subsection{Expansion of the curvature function for $J=2,3,4$}

To obtain the strong coupling expansion of our exact results for the curvature function, we evaluated it numerically with high precision for a range of values of $g$ and then made a fit to find the expansion coefficients. It would also be interesting to carry out the expansion analytically, and we leave this for the future.

For numerical study it is convenient to write our exact expressions \eq{gamma2L2}, \eq{gamma2L3}, \eq{gamma2L4} for $\gamma^{(2)}(g)$, which have the form
\beq
\label{ints}
	\gamma^{(2)}(g)=\oint {du_x}\oint {du_y} f(x,y) \partial_{u_x} \log\frac{\Gamma (i u_x-i u_y+1)}{\Gamma (1-i u_x+i u_y)}
\eeq
where the integration goes around the branch cut between $-2g$ and $2g$, in a slightly different way (we remind that we use notation $x+\frac{1}{x}=\frac{u_x}{g}$ and $y+\frac{1}{y}=\frac{u_y}{g}$). Namely, by changing the variables of integration to $x,y$ and integrating by parts one can write the result as
\beq
\label{ints2}
	\gamma^{(2)}(g)=\oint {dx}\oint {dy} F(x,y) \log\frac{\Gamma (i u_x-i u_y+1)}{\Gamma (i u_y-i u_x+1)}
\eeq
where $F(x,y)$ is some polynomial in the following variables: $x,\;1/x,\;y,\;1/y,\;\sh_-^x$ and $\sh_-^y$ (for $J=3$ it includes $\ch_-^x,\;\ch_-^y$ instead of the $\sh_-$ functions). The integral in \eq{ints2} is over the unit circle. The advantage of this representation is that plugging in $\sh_-^x$, $\sh_-^y$ as series expansions (truncated to some large order), we see that it only remains to compute integrals of the kind
\beqa
C_{r,s}&=&\frac{1}{i}\oint\frac{dx}{2\pi}\oint\frac{dy}{2\pi}x^r y^s\log\frac{\Gamma(i u_x-iu_y+1)}{\Gamma(i u_y-iu_x+1)}
\eeqa
These are nothing but the coefficients of the BES dressing phase \cite{Beisert:2006ez,Dorey:2007xn,Beisert:2006ib,Vieira:2010kb}. They can be conveniently computed using the strong coupling expansion \cite{Beisert:2006ez}
\beq
C_{r,s}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\[-\frac{2^{-n-1} (-\pi )^{-n} g^{1-n} \zeta_n
   \left(1-(-1)^{r+s+4}\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{2}
   (n-r+s-1)\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{2}
   (n+r+s+1)\right)}{\Gamma (n-1) \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{2}
   (-n-r+s+3)\right) \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{2} (-n+r+s+5)\right)}\]
\eeq
However this expansion is only asymptotic and does not converge. For fixed $g$ the terms will start growing with $n$ when $n$ is greater than some value $N$, and we only summed the terms up to $n=N$ which gives the value of $C_{r,s}$ with very good precision for large \text{enough $g$}.

Using this approach we computed the curvature function for a range of values of $g$ (typically we took $7\leq g \leq 30$) and then fitted the result as an expansion in $1/g$. This gave us only numerical values of the expansion coefficients, but in fact we found that with very high precision the coefficients are as follows. For $J=2$
\beqa
\label{eq:ssj2}
\gamma^{(2)}_{J=2}&=&-\pi ^2 g^2+\frac{\pi  g}{4}+\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{\pi g}\(\frac{3 \zeta_3}{16}+\frac{3}{512}\)-\frac{1}{\pi^2g^2}\(\frac{9 \zeta_3}{128}+\frac{21}{512}\)
\\ \nn
&+&
\frac{1}{\pi^3g^3}\(\frac{3 \zeta_3}{2048}+\frac{15 \zeta_5}{512}-\frac{3957}{131072}\) + \dots\;,
\eeqa
then for $J=3$
\beqa
\label{eq:ssj3}
\gamma^{(2)}_{J=3}&=&-\frac{8 \pi ^2 g^2}{27}+\frac{2 \pi  g}{27}+\frac{1}{12}-
\frac{1}{\pi g}\(
\frac{1}{216}
+\frac{\zeta_3}{8}
\)-
\frac{1}{\pi^2g^2}\(\frac{3 \zeta_3}{64}+\frac{743}{13824}\)
\\ \nn
&+&
\frac{1}{\pi^3g^3}\(\frac{41 \zeta_3}{1024}+\frac{35 \zeta_5}{512}-\frac{5519}{147456}\) + \dots\;,
\eeqa
and finally for $J=4$
\beqa
\gamma^{(2)}_{J=4}&=&-\frac{\pi ^2 g^2}{8}+\frac{\pi  g}{32}+\frac{1}{16}-\frac{1}{\pi g}\(\frac{3 \zeta_3}{32}+\frac{15}{4096}\)-\frac{0.01114622551913}{g^2}
\\ \nn
&+&\frac{0.004697583899}{g^3}+ \dots\;.
\eeqa
To fix coefficients for the first four terms in the expansion we were guided by known analytic predictions which will be discussed below, and found that our numerical result matches these predictions with high precision. Then for $J=2$ and $J=3$ we extracted the numerical values obtained from the fit for the coefficients of $1/g^2$ and $1/g^3$, and plugging them into the online calculator EZFace \cite{ezface} we obtained a prediction for their exact values as combinations of $\zeta_3$ and $\zeta_5$. Fitting again our numerical results with these exact values fixed, we found that the precision of the fit at the previous orders in $1/g$ increased. This is a highly nontrivial test for the proposed exact values of $1/g^2$ and $1/g^3$ terms. For $J=2$ we confirmed the coefficients of these terms with absolute precision $10^{-17}$ and $10^{-15}$ at $1/g^2$ and $1/g^3$ respectively (at previous orders of the expansion the precision is even higher). For $J=3$ the precision was correspondingly $10^{-15}$ and $10^{-13}$.

For $J=4$ we were not able to get a stable fit for the $1/g^2$ and $1/g^3$ coefficients from EZFace, so above we gave their numerical values (with uncertainty in the last digit). However below we will see that based on $J=2$ and $J=3$ results one can make a prediction for these coefficients, which we again confirmed by checking that precision of the fit at the previous orders in $1/g$ increases. The precision of the final fit at orders $1/g^2$ and $1/g^3$ is $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-14}$ respectively.

\subsection{Update on short strings}

Here we will find an analytic expression for the strong coupling expansion of the curvature function which generalizes the formulas \eqref{eq:ssj2} and \eqref{eq:ssj3} to any $J$. To this end it will be beneficial to consider the structure of classical expansions of the scaling dimension. A good entry point is considering the inverse relation $S(\Delta)$, frequently encountered in the context of BFKL. It satisfies a few basic properties, namely the curve $S(\Delta)$ goes through the points $(\pm J, 0)$ at any coupling, because at $S=0$ the operator is BPS. At the same time for non-BPS states
one should have $\Delta(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{1/4}\to\infty$ \cite{Gubser:1998bc} which indicates that if $\Delta$ is fixed, $S$ should go to zero, thus combining this with the knowledge of fixed points $(\pm J, 0)$ we conclude that at infinite coupling $S(\Delta)$ is simply the line $S = 0$. As the coupling becomes finite $S(\Delta)$ starts bending from the $S=0$ line and starts looking like a parabola going through the points $\pm J$, see fig. \ref{pic:bfkl}. Based on this qualitative picture and the scaling $\Delta(\lambda)\propto \lambda^{1/4}$ at $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$ and fixed $J$ and $S$, one can write down the following ansatz,
\beqa
\label{eq:sofdelta}
	S(\Delta) &=& \left( \Delta^2 - J^2\right)\Bigl( \alpha_1 \frac{1}{\lambda^{1/2}} + \alpha_2 \frac{1}{\lambda} + (\alpha_3 + \beta_3 \Delta^2) \frac{1}{\lambda^{3/2}} + (\alpha_4 + \beta_4 \Delta^2) \frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}   \Bigr.\\
	\nn
	&+&
	\Bigl.
	(\alpha_5 + \beta_5 \Delta^2+\gamma_5\Delta^4) \frac{1}{\lambda^{5/2}}
	+(\alpha_6 + \beta_6 \Delta^2+\gamma_6\Delta^4) \frac{1}{\lambda^{3}}
	+\dots
	\Bigr).
\eeqa
We omit odd powers of the scaling dimension from the ansatz, as only the square of $\Delta$ enters the $\bf{P}\mu$-system. We can now invert the relation and express $\Delta$ in terms of $S$ at strong coupling, which gives
\beq
\label{eq:delta_squared_basso}
\Delta^2=J^2+S
\(
A_1\sqrt{\lambda}+A_2+\dots
\)
+S^2
\(
B_1+\frac{B_2}{\sqrt\lambda}
+\dots
\)
+S^3
\(
\frac{C_1}{\lambda^{1/2}}
+\frac{C_2}{\lambda}
+\dots
\)
+{\cal O}({ S}^4)\;,
\eeq
where the coefficients $A_i,\;B_i,\;C_i$ are some functions of $J$. There exists a one-to-one mapping between the coefficients $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, etc. and $A_i$, $B_i$ etc, which is rather complicated but easy to find. We note that this structure of $\Delta^2$ coincides with Basso's conjecture in \cite{Basso:2011rs} for mode number $n=1$ \footnote{The generalization of \eq{eq:delta_squared_basso} for $n>1$ is not fully clear, as noted in \cite{Gromov:2011bz}, and this case will be discussed in appendix \ref{sec:appN}.}. The pattern in \eq{eq:delta_squared_basso} continues to higher orders in $S$ with further coefficients $D_i$, $E_i$, etc. and powers of $\lambda$ suppressed incrementally. This structure is a nontrivial constraint on $\Delta$ itself as one easily finds from \eq{eq:delta_squared_basso} that
\beqa
\Delta&=&J+\frac{S}{2J}
\(
A_1\sqrt{\lambda}+A_2+\frac{A_3}{\sqrt{\lambda}}+\dots
\)\\
\nn&+&S^2
\(
- \frac{A_1^2}{8J^3} \, \lambda
-  \frac{A_1A_2}{4J^3} \, \sqrt{\lambda}
+\[\frac{B_1}{2J}-\frac{A_2^2+2A_1 A_3}{8J^3}\]
+
\[
\frac{B_2}{2J}
-\frac{A_2A_3+A_1A_4}{4J^3}
\]  \frac{1}{\sqrt\lambda}
+\dots
\).
\eeqa
By definition the coefficients of $S$ and $S^2$ are the slope and curvature functions respectively, so now we have their expansions at strong coupling in terms of $A_i,\;B_i,\;C_i$, etc. Since the $S$ coefficient only contains the constants $A_i$, we can find all of their values by simply expanding the slope function \eq{eq:resultLO} at strong coupling. We get
\beq
\label{eq:bassos_as}
A_1=2\;\;,\;\;
A_2=-1\;\;,\;\;
A_3=J^2-\frac{1}{4}\;\;,\;\;
A_4=J^2-\frac{1}{4}\dots\;.
\eeq
Note that in this series the power of $J$ increases by two at every other member, which is a direct consequence of omitting odd powers of $\Delta$ from \eq{eq:sofdelta}. We also expect the same pattern to hold for the coefficients $B_i$, $C_i$, etc.

The curvature function written in terms of $A_i$, $B_i$, etc. is given by
\beqa
	\label{eq:ss_abc}
	\gamma^{(2)}_{J}(g) &=& -\frac{2 \pi ^2 g^2 A_1^2 }{J^3} - \frac{\pi g A_1 A_2 }{J^3}-\frac{A_2^2+2 A_1 A_3-4 B_1 J^2}{8 J^3} - \frac{A_2 A_3+A_1 A_4-2 B_2 J^2}{16 \pi g J^3} \\
	&-&  \frac{A_3^2+2 A_2 A_4+2 A_1 A_5-4 B_3 J^2}{128 \pi^2 g^2 J^3} - \frac{A_3 A_4 + A_2 A_5 + A_1 A_6 - 2 B_4 J^2}{256 \pi^3 g^3 J^3} + \mc{O}\left(\frac{1}{g^4}\right). \nonumber
\eeqa
The remaining unknowns here (up to order $1/g^4$) are $B_1$, $B_2$, which we expect to be constant due to the power pattern noticed above and $B_3$, $B_4$, which we expect to have the form $a J^2 + b$ with $a$ and $b$ constant.
These unknowns are immediately fixed by comparing the general curvature expansion \eq{eq:ss_abc} to the two explicit cases that we know for $J=2$ and $J=3$. We find
\beq
\label{eq:b1b2}
B_1=3/2\;\;,\;\;B_2=-3\,\zeta_3+\frac{3}{8},
\eeq
and
\beqa
\label{eq:b3b4}
	B_{3} = -\frac{J^2}{2}-\frac{9 \, \zeta_3}{2}+\frac{5}{16} \;\;,\;\; B_{4} = \frac{3}{16} J^2 (16 \, \zeta_3+20 \, \zeta_5-9)-\frac{15 \, \zeta_5}{2}-\frac{93 \, \zeta_3}{8}-\frac{3}{16}.
\eeqa
Having fixed all the unknowns we can write the strong coupling expansion of the curvature function for arbitrary values of $J$ as
\beqa
 \gamma^{(2)}_{J}(g) &=& -\frac{8 \pi ^2 g^2}{J^3}+\frac{2 \pi  g}{J^3}+\frac{1}{4 J}+\frac{1-J^2 (24 \, \zeta_3 +1)}{64 \pi  g J^3} - \frac{8 J^4+J^2 (72 \, \zeta_3 +11)-4}{512 g^2 \left(\pi ^2 J^3\right)}  \nonumber \\
  &+& \frac{3 \left(8 J^4 (16 \, \zeta_3 +20 \, \zeta_5-7)-16 J^2 (31 \, \zeta_3 +20 \, \zeta_5+7)+25\right)}{16384 \pi ^3 g^3 J^3} + \mc{O}\left(\frac{1}{g^4}\right).
\eeqa
Expanding $\gamma^{(2)}_{J=4}$ defined in \eq{gamma2L4} at strong coupling numerically we were able to confirm the above result with high precision.




%\subsection{Anomalous dimension of short operators}
%\label{sec:Konishidimension}

In this section we will use the knowledge of slope functions $\gamma^{(n)}_J$ at strong coupling to find the strong coupling expansions of scaling dimensions of operators with finite $S$ and $J$, in particular we will find the three loop coefficient of the Konishi operator by utilizing the techniques of
\cite{Basso:2011rs,Gromov:2011bz}. What follows is a quick recap of the main ideas in these papers. 

We are interested in the coefficients of the strong coupling expansion of $\Delta$, namely
\beq
	\Delta = \Delta^{(0)} \lambda^\frac{1}{4} + \Delta^{(1)} \lambda^{-\frac{1}{4}}  + \Delta^{(2)} \lambda^{-\frac{3}{4}} + \Delta^{(3)} \lambda^{-\frac{5}{4}} + \dots
\eeq
First, we use Basso's conjecture \eq{eq:delta_squared_basso} and by fixing $S$ and $J$ we re-expand the square root of $\Delta^2$ at strong coupling to find
\beq
	\label{eq:delta_abc}
	\Delta = \sqrt{A_1 S} \, \sqrt[4]{\lambda}  + \frac{\sqrt{A_1} \left( J^2 + A_2 S + B_1 S^2 \right)}{2 A_1 \sqrt{S}} \, \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{\lambda}} + {\cal O}\(\frac{1}{\lambda^\frac{3}{4}}\).
\eeq
Thus we reformulate the problem entirely in terms of the coefficients $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$, etc. For example, the next coefficient in the series, namely the two-loop term is given by
\beq
	\label{eq:delta_2loops_abc}
	\Delta^{(2)} = -\frac{\left(2 A_2 + 4 B_1+J^2\right)^2-16 A_1 (A_3+2 B_2+4 C_1)}{16 \sqrt{2} A_2^{3/2}}.
\eeq
Further coefficients become more and more complicated, however a very clear pattern can be noticed after looking at these expressions: we see that the term $\Delta^{(n)}$ only contains coefficients with indices up to $n+1$, e.g. the tree level term $\Delta^{(0)}$  only depends on $A_1$, the one-loop term depends on $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, etc. Thus we can associate the index of these coefficients with the loop level. Conversely, from the last section we learned that the letter of $A_i$, $B_i$, etc. can be associated with the order in $S$, i.e. the slope function fixed all $A_i$ coefficients and the curvature function in principle fixes all $B_i$ coefficients.

%\subsubsection{Matching with classical and semiclassical results}

Looking at \eq{eq:delta_abc} we see that knowing $A_i$ and $B_i$ only takes us to one loop, in order to proceed we need to know some coefficients in the $C_i$ and $D_i$ series. This is where the next ingredient in this construction comes in, which is the knowledge of the classical energy and its semiclassical correction in the Frolov-Tseytlin limit, i.e. when $\mc S \equiv S/\sqrt\lambda$ and $\mc J \equiv J/\sqrt\lambda$ remain fixed, while $S$, $J$, $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$. Additionally we will also be taking the limit $\cal{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{0}$ in all of the expressions that follow. In particular, the square of the classical energy has a very nice form in these limits and is given by \cite{Gromov:2011de,Gromov:2011bz}
\beqa
 \label{delta_tree}
 {\cal D}_{\rm classical}^2&=&{\cal J}^2+2 \, {\cal S} \, \sqrt{{\cal J}^2+1}+{\cal S}^2 \, \frac{2 {\cal J}^2+3}{2
   {\cal J}^2+2}-{\cal S}^3 \, \frac{{\cal J}^2+3}{8
   \left({\cal J}^2+1\right)^{5/2}}
   +{\cal O}\left({\cal S}^4\right)\;,
\eeqa
where ${\cal D}_{\rm classical} \equiv \Delta_{classical} / \sqrt{\lambda}$. The 1-loop correction to the classical energy is given by
\beqa
\label{delta_oneloop}
\Delta_{sc} \simeq
\frac{-{\cal S}}{2 \left({\cal J}^3+{\cal J}\right)}+{\cal S}^2\[\frac{3 {\cal J}^4+11 {\cal J}^2+17
   }{16 {\cal J}^3 \left({\cal J}^2+1\right)^{5/2}}
\!-\!\sum_{\substack{m>0 \\ m\neq n}}\frac{n^3m^2  \left(2 m^2+n^2 {\cal J}^2-n^2\right)}{{\cal J}^3 \left(m^2-n^2\right)^2
   \left(m^2+n^2 {\cal J}^2\right)^{3/2}}\]
\eeqa
If the parameters $\cal{S}$ and $\cal{J}$ are fixed to some values then the sum can be evaluated explicitly in terms of zeta functions. We now add up the classical and the 1-loop contributions\footnote{Note that they mix various orders of the coupling.}, take $S$ and $J$ fixed at strong coupling and compare the result to \eq{eq:delta_squared_basso}. By requiring consistency we are able to extract the following coefficients,
$$
 \label{eq:abcd2}
 \begin{array}{rcrlrlrcl}
  A_1 &=&  &2, &A_2&  &=& -&1  \\
  B_1 &=&  &3/2, &B_2&  &=& -&3\,\zeta_3+\frac{3}{8}  \\
  C_1 &=& -&3/8, &C_2& &=& &\frac{1}{16} \, (60 \, \zeta_3 + 60 \, \zeta_5 - 17) \\
  D_1 &=&  &31/64, &D_2& &=& & \frac{1}{512} (-5520 \, \zeta_3 - 5120 \, \zeta_5 -3640 \, \zeta_7 +901)
 \end{array}
$$
As discussed in the previous section, we can in principle extract all coefficients with indices $1$ and $2$. In order to find e.g. $B_3$ we would need to extend the quantization of the classical solution to the next order. Note that the coefficients $A_1$, $A_2$ and $B_1$, $B_2$ have the same exact values that we extracted from the slope and curvature functions.

\caption{Comparisons of strong coupling expansion coefficients for $\lambda^{-5/4}$ obtained from fits to TBA data versus our predictions for various operators. The fit order is the order of polynomials used for the rational fit function (see \cite{Gromov:2011bz} for details).}
\label{tab:coefficients}
\end{table}

The key observation in \cite{Gromov:2011bz} was that once written in terms of the coefficients $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$, the two-loop term $\Delta^{(2)}$ only depends on $A_{1,2,3}$, $B_{1,2}$, $C_{1}$ as can be seen in \eq{eq:delta_2loops_abc}. As discussed in the last section, the one-loop result fixes all of these constants except $A_3$, which in principle is a contribution from a true two-loop calculation. However we already fixed it from the slope function and thus we are able to find
\beq
	\Delta^{(2)} = \frac{-21\,S^4 +(24-96\,\zeta_3) S^3+4 \left(5 J^2-3\right) S^2+8 J^2 S -4 J^4}{64 \sqrt{2}\,S^{3/2}}.
\eeq
Now that we know the strong coupling expansion of the curvature function and thus all the coefficients $B_i$, we can do the same trick and find the three loop strong coupling scaling dimension coefficient $\Delta^{(3)}$, which now depends on $A_{1;2;3;4}$, $B_{1,2,3}$, $C_{1,2}$, $D_1$. We find it to be
\beqa
	\Delta^{(3)} &=& \frac{187\,S^6 + 2\,(624\,\zeta_3 + 480\,\zeta_5-193)\,S^5 +\left(-146\,J^2 - 4\,(336\,\zeta_3-41)\right)S^4 }{512 \sqrt{2}\,S^{5/2}} + \nonumber \\
	&+& \frac{\left(32\,(6\,\zeta_3+7)\,J^2-88\right)S^3 + \left(-28\,J^4 + 40\,J^2\right) S^2 - 24\,J^4 S + 8\,J^6}{512 \sqrt{2}\,S^{5/2}},
\eeqa
for $S=2$ it simplifies to
\beq
	\Delta^{(3)}_{S=2} = \frac{1}{512} \left(J^6-20 J^4+48 J^2 (4 \zeta_3 - 1)+192 (12 \, \zeta_3+20 \, \zeta_5+1)\right)
\eeq
and finally for the Konishi operator, which has $S=2$ and $J=2$ we get\footnote{The $\zeta_3$ and $\zeta_5$ terms are coming from semi-classics and were already known before \cite{Beccaria:2012xm} and match our result.}
 \beq
  \Delta^{(3)}_{S=2,J=2} = \frac{15 \, \zeta_5}{2} + 6 \, \zeta_3-\frac{1}{2}.
 \eeq
In order to compare our predictions with data available from TBA calculations \cite{Frolov:2010wt}, we employed Pad\'{e} type fits as explained in \cite{Gromov:2011bz}. The fit results are shown in table \ref{tab:coefficients}, we see that our predictions are within $5\%$ error bounds, which is a rather good agreement. However we must be honest that for the $J=3$ and especially $J=4$ states we did not have as many data points as for the $J=2$ state and the fit is somewhat shaky.
