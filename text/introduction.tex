\section{Introduction}

In this section we give a brief history of the developments in the subject and an overview for the thesis.

\subsection{Brief history of the subject}

QCD is hard, $\N=4$ is easier. From Maldacena to Zarembo, Bethe ansatz, asyptotics, strings, algebraic curves, matching. Finally TBA, $\pmu$. Of course still a lot of things to do.

\subsection{Thesis overview}

Maybe a nice picture for the structure of the thesis.
