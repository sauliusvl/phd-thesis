\section{Introduction}

The title of this thesis is \emph{Exact Results in $\N=4$ Super Yang-Mills}. A reasonable question to ask is -- why would anyone care about that ? 
After all $\N=4$ is just a toy theory, it is not something that nature implements and thus we can not observe it in particle accelerators, as opposed to say the Standard Model of particle physics. 
And indeed those are all valid points, however there are very good reasons for studying $\N=4$ SYM. 

From a pragmatic point of view, it is the simplest non-trivial quantum field theory in four spacetime dimensions and since attempts at solving realistic QFTs such as the theory of strong interactions (QCD) have so far been futile, it seems like a good starting point -- some go as far as calling it the harmonic oscillator of QFTs. 

Another (and probably the main) reason why $\N=4$ has been receiving so much attention in the last decades is the long list of mysterious and intriguing properties it seems to posses, making it almost an intelectual pursuit of understanding it. 
The theory has been surprising the theoretical physics community from the very beginning: it is a rare instance of a conformal theory in dimensions higher than two, it has a dual description in terms of a string theory and more recently it was discovered to be integrable. 
All of these properties give reasonable hope for actually solving the theory exactly, something that has never been achieved before for any four dimensional interacting QFT.

In the remainder of the section we give a proper introduction to the subject from a historic point of view focusing on its integrability aspect, for it is integrability that allows one to actually find exact results in the theory. We then give an overview of the thesis itself, emphasizing which parts of the text are reviews of known material and which parts constitute original work.

\subsection{Brief history of the subject}

Quantum field theory has been at the spot light of theoretical physics since the beginning of the century when it was found that electromagnetism is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Since then people have been trying to fit other forces of nature into the QFT framework. 
Ultimately it worked: the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics or QCD for short, together with the electroweak theory, spontaneously broken down to QED, collectively make up the \emph{Standard Model} of particle physics, which has been extensively tested in particle accelerators since then. 

However nature did not give away her secrets without a fight. 
For some time it was though that strong interactions were described by a theory of vibrating strings, as it seemed to incorporate the so-called Regge trajectories observed in experiments \cite{Veneziano:1968}. 
Even after discovering QCD, which is a Yang-Mills gauge theory, stringy aspects of it were still evident and largely mysterious. 
Most notably lattice gauge theory calculations at strong coupling suggested that surfaces of color-electric fluxes between quarks could be given the interpretation of stretched strings \cite{Wilson:1974}, thus an idea of a gauge-string duality was starting to emerge. 
It was strongly re-enforced by t'Hooft, who showed that the perturbative expansion of $U(N)$ gauge theories in the large $N$ limit could be rearranged into a genus expansion of surfaces triangulated by the double-line Feynman graphs, which strongly resembles string theory genus expansions \cite{THooft:1974}.

However it was the work of Maldacena in 1997 that sparked a true revolution \cite{Maldacena:1997re}. 
He formulated the first concrete conjecture, now universally referred to as \emph{AdS/CFT}, for a duality between a gauge theory, the maximally supersymmetric $\N=4$ super Yang-Mills, and type IIB string theory on $\adsfive$. 
Polyakov had already shown that non-critical string theory in four-dimensions describing gauge fields should be complemented with an extra Liouville-like direction thus enriching the space to a curved five dimensional manifold \cite{Polyakov:1997tj}. Furthermore the gauge theory had to be defined on the boundary of this manifold.
Maldacena's conjecture was consistent with this view, as the gauge theory was defined on the boundary of $AdS_5$, whereas the $S^5$ was associated with the internal symmetries of the gauge fields.
The idea of a higher dimensional theory being fully described by a theory living on the boundary was also considered before in the context of black hole physics \cite{'tHooft:1993gx, Susskind:1994vu} and goes by the name of holography.

The duality can be motivated by considering a stack of parallel D3 branes in type IIB string theory. 
Open strings moving on the branes can be described by $\N=4$ SYM with the gauge group $SU(N)$ [??]. 
Roughly the idea is that there are six extra dimensions transverse to the stack of branes, thus a string stretching between two of them can be viewed as a set of six scalar fields ${(\Phi^i)^a}_b$ defined in four dimensional spacetime carrying two extra indices denoting the branes it is attached to. 
These are precisely the indices of the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$.
A similar argument can be put forward for other fields thus recovering the field content of $\N=4$ SYM.
Far away from the branes we have closed strings propagating in empty space. 
In the low energy limit these systems decouple and far away from the branes we are left with ten dimensional supergravity.

Another way of looking at this system is considering the branes as a defect in spacetime, which from the point of view of supergravity is a source of curvature. 
The supergravity solution carrying D3 brane charge can be written down explicity \cite{Horowitz:1991cd}.
Far away from the branes it is obviously once again the usual flat space ten dimensional supergravity.
However the near horizon geometry of the brane system becomes $\adsfive$.
Since both points of view end up with supergravity far away from the branes, one is tempted to identify the theories close to the branes, $\N=4$ SYM and type IIB string theory on $\adsfive$. 
This is exactly what Maldacena did in his seminal paper \cite{Maldacena:1997re}. Since then other dualities have been discovered that are very similar in spirit \cite{Aharony:2008ug}, however in this thesis we will only concentrate on the original one.

By studying the supergravity solution one can identify the parameters of the theories, namely $\N=4$ SYM is parameterized by the coupling constant $g_{YM}$ and the number of colors $N$, whereas string theory has the string coupling constant $g_s$ and the string length squared $\alpha'$. 
These are identified in the following way
\beq
	 4\pi g_s = g_{YM}^2 \equiv \frac{\lambda}{N}, \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \frac{R^4}{\alpha'^2} = \lambda,
\eeq
where $\lambda$ is the t'Hooft coupling and $R$ is the radius of both $AdS_5$ and $S_5$, which is fixed as only the ratio $R^2/\alpha'$ is measurable.
A few things are to be noted here. First of all, the identification directly implements t'Hooft's idea of large $N$ expansion of gauge theory, since $g_s \sim 1/N$. 
In fact in the large $N$ limit only planar Feynman graphs survive and everything simplifies dramatically, a fact that we will take advantage of a lot in this thesis.
In this limit the effective coupling constant of the gauge theory is $\lambda$. 

The supergravity approximation is valid when $\alpha' \ll R^2$, which corresponds to strongly coupled gauge theory, thus the conjecture is of the weak-strong type. 
This fact is a blessing in disguise, since initially it seems very restrictive as one can not easily compare results of the theories. 
However it provides a possibility to access strongly coupled regimes of both theories, which was beyond reach before. 
Prescriptions for matching up observables on both sides of the correspondence were given in \cite{Gubser:1998bc, Witten:1998qj}. 
However because of the weak-strong nature of the duality initial tests were performed only for BPS states, which are protected from quantum corrections.
The first direct match was observed in \cite{Witten:1998qj} where it was shown that the spectrum of half-BPS single trace operators matches the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity.
Another indirect confirmation of the conjecture was the formulation of type IIB string theory as a super-coset sigma model on the target space $PSU(2,2|4) / SO(2,4) \otimes SO(6)$, which has the same global symmetries as $\N=4$ SYM \cite{Metsaev:1998it}.

The situation changed dramatically in 2002 when Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase devised a way to go beyond BPS checks \cite{Berenstein:2002jq}. 
The idea was to take an operator in gauge theory with large R-charge $J$ and add some some impurities, effectively making it ``near-BPS''.
The canonical example of such an operator is $\tr(Z^J X^S)$, where $Z$ and $X$ are two complex scalar fields of $\N=4$ SYM, with $X$ being the impurities ($S \ll J$).
Since anomalous dimensions are suppressed like $\lambda/J^2$, perturbative gauge theory calculations are valid even at large $\lambda$, as long as $\lambda' \equiv \lambda / J^2 \ll 1$ and $N$ is large.
It is thus possible to compare gauge theory calculations with string theory results.
From the string theory point of view this limit corresponds to excitations of point-like strings with angular momentum $J$ moving at the speed of light around the great circle of $S^5$. 
The background seen by this string is the so-called pp-wave geometry and string theory in this background is tractible.

The discovery of the BMN limit was arguably the first time it was explicitly demonstrated how the world sheet theory of a string can be reconstructed by a physical picture of scalar fields dubbed as ``impurities'' propagating in a closed single trace operator of ``background'' scalar fields of the gauge theory. 
Shortly after this discovery Minahan and Zarembo revolutionized the subject once again by discovering Integrability at the end of 2002 \cite{Minahan:2002ve}.
They showed that in the large $N$ limit single-trace operators of scalar fields can be identified with spin chains and their anomalous dimensions at one-loop in weak coupling are given by the energies of the corresponding spin chain states.
These spin-chain systems are known to be integrable, which in practice allows one to solve the problem exactly using techniques such as the Bethe ansatz \cite{Bethe:1931}. 
This discovery sparked a very rapid development of integrability methods in AdS/CFT during the coming years.

Solving a quantum field theory in principle means finding all $n$-point correlation functions of all physical observables. 
Since $\N=4$ SYM is conformal it is enough to find all 2-point and 3-point correlators, as all higher point correlation functions can be decomposed in terms of these basic constituents.
Due to conformal symmetry the two-point functions only depend on the scaling dimensions of operators, whereas for three point functions one also needs the so called structure constants $C_{ijk}$ in addtion to the scaling dimensions.
Integrability methods from the very beginning mainly focused on solving the spectral problem in the large $N$ limit, that is finding the spectrum of operators with definite anomalous dimensions and their exact numeric values.
The initial discovery of \cite{Minahan:2002ve} was that the spectral problem was analogous to diagonalizing a spin chain Hamiltonian, which is the dilatation operator of the superconformal symmetry of the theory.
The eigenstates correspond to operators in the gauge theory and the eigenvalues are their anomalous dimensions.

Soon after the initial discovery of integrability a spin chain formulation at one-loop was found for the full $PSU(2,2|4)$ theory, not only the scalar sector \cite{Beisert:2003jj}. 
The result was also extended to two and three loops \cite{Beisert:2003tq}. 
Integrability was also discovered at strong coupling as it was shown that the Metsaev-Tseytlin sigma model is classicaly integrable \cite{Bena:2003wd}. 
With integrability methods now being available at both weak and strong coupling it was now possible to compare results in the BMN limit.
As expected, comparisons in the first two orders of the BMN coupling constant $\lambda'$ showed promising agreement \cite{Frolov:2003qc, Frolov:2003xy, Arutyunov:2003uj}, however an order of limits problem emerged at three loops \cite{Beisert:2003tq}. 

All of these results seemed to suggest that integrability may be an all loop phenomenon, only the surface of it being scratched so far. 
This notion was strongly reinforced when classical string integrability was reformulated in the elegant language of algebraic curves by Kazakov, Marshakov, Minahan and Zarembo (KMMZ), which made the connection with weak coupling more manifest \cite{Kazakov:2004qf}. 
The algebraic curve was interpreted as the continuum limit of Bethe equations, which made it possible to speculate about all loop equations.
The first such attempt was made by Beisert, Dippel and Staudacher (BDS), who conjectured a set of Bethe equations and a dispresion relation which together sucessfully showcased some all-loop features \cite{Beisert:2004hm}.
This result was later extended to all sectors of the theory \cite{Beisert:2005fw}.
The BDS result was quickly shown to be incomplete as it was lacking a so-called dressing phase \cite{Arutyunov:2004vx}, a scalar function not constrained by symmetry of the problem.
It was found to leading order at strong coupling in \cite{Arutyunov:2004vx} and later to one-loop in \cite{Hernandez:2006tk}.
A crossing equation satisfied by the dressing phase was soon found \cite{Janik:2006dc} and eventually solved by Beisert, Hernandez and Lopez (BHL) \cite{Beisert:2006ib}.  
Collectively these results are often refered to as the asymptotic Bethe ansatz (ABA), reminding that they are valid only for asymptotically long spin chains. 
When the states are short so-called wrapping effects become relevant. 
At weak coupling they manifest as long-range spin chain interactions wrapping around the chain, whereas at strong coupling they are due to virtual particles self-interacting across the circumreference of the worldsheet \cite{Sieg:2005kd, Ambjorn:2005wa}.

Once the asymptotic solution was found attention shifted to finite size corrections, resolving which would give the complete solution to the spectral problem. 
Finite size scattering corrections in finite volume for any QFT were first addressed by L\"{u}scher \cite{Luscher:1986}, who derived a set of universal formulas. 
This approach, while very general and not directly related to integrability, was employed to calculate four \cite{Bajnok:2008bm} and five loop coefficients \cite{Bajnok:2009vm} of the anomalous dimension of the simplest non-BPS operator with length two, the Konishi operator.
The results agreed with available diagramatic four-loop calculations \cite{Fiamberti:2007rj} and gave a new prediction for five loops.

An alternative approach more in line with integrability is the Thermodynamic Bete Ansatz (TBA), which can be traced back to Yang and Yang \cite{Yang} and was popularized by Alexei Zamolodchikov \cite{Zamolodchikov1, Zamolodchikov2}. 
The idea is to consider the partition function of a two dimensional CFT and it's ``mirror'' image found after exchanging length and time with a modular transformation.
At large imaginary times the partition function will be dominated by the ground state energy, whereas in the mirror theory large time means asymptotic length, which is under control using the asymptotic Bethe ansatz techniques.
Thus one can evaluate the partition function using the saddle point method and after rotating back to the original theory compute the exact ground state energy. 
Excited states can then be reached using analytic continuation. 
This approach was already proposed as an option for the AdS/CFT system in \cite{Ambjorn:2005wa} and was first discussed in \cite{Arutyunov:2007tc}.
The TBA approach crystalized in 2009 with multiple groups publishing results almost simultaneously \cite{Gromov:2009tv, Bombardelli:2009ns, Gromov:2009bc, Arutyunov:2009ur, Cavaglia:2010nm}.
Soon the Konishi anomalous dimension was checked at four \cite{Gromov:2009bc} and five \cite{Arutyunov:2010gb, Balog:2010xa} loops by linearizing the TBA equations, showing precise agreement with results obtained using the L\"{u}scher method.

The TBA equations seem to be the ultimate result in the quest of solving the spectral problem as they offer the full and complete result, all contributions are accounted for.
However it soon became apparent that something is still lacking in our understanding of the solution as it seemed to be too complicated.
Indeed the TBA equations are an infinite set of coupled integral equations, furthermore there is no recipe to formulate them for an arbitrary state, only isolated cases such as the Konishi and cusped Wilson lines are known [??].
Once the equations are found one has to employ numerous numerical tricks to actually solve them, again this mostly works in a case-by-case basis.
Some attempts at simplifying the TBA approach were already seen in [??], where the equations were recast into a set of algebraic equations for an infinite set of $Y$-functions together with some analyticity constraints.
A further step was taken when it was discovered that the infinite set of equations can be traded in for a finite set of non-linear integral equations (FiNLIE) [??].
The latest development in this area was the introduction of the $\pmu$ system in 2014 [??], also refered to as the quantum spectral curve.
In this approach the spectral problem is formulated as a Riemann-Hilbert problem for 5 functions, reducing all the complexity to a problem in complex analysis.
The $\pmu$ system quickly showed its potential as many results were derived without much effort [??].

Even though there are still many things to be learned, it is safe to say that the spectral problem is mostly understood.
