- abstract: "a recurring concept being the
Konishi anomalous dimension" but it's a quantity, not a concept, so
maybe consider rephrasing

- when you write about the slope in abstarct, it gives the impression
that you derived it; maybe mention that you reproduce a known result;
same in first paragraph of sec 3

- next-to-last sentence in abstract: "which is known to be integrable"
is a bit redundant

Introduction:
- "it is a rare instance of a conformal theory in dimensions higher
than two" not really true...

- "triangulated by the double-line Feynman graphs" - not sure it's
really a triangulation

- "With integrability methods now being available at both weak and
strong coupling it was possible to compare results in the BMN limit."
- not sure whether it's appropriate to call it BMN or instead
Frolov-Tsytlin limit, are they the same?

- "to consider the partition function of a two dimensional integrable
CFT" not CFT but QFT

- "Cases such as the sl(2) sector of the theory, containing the
Konishi operator [40] and cusped Wilson lines"- cusped WLs are not in
sl(2) sector, this is a different problem altogether

- "reduced to a Riemann-Hilbert problem for
eight Q functions" - a bit stretched as actually equations are simple
for mu+P or omega+Q, but not P+Q

- "Probably the most famous
example" -> "Probably the most famous other
example"

- "new results were
being rapidly discovered [51, 52]" consider adding here Volin's to
appear about 9 loop Konishi, or Gromov's last paper on BFKL

section 2:
- "the function was shown to be identically zero to all orders in
perturbation theory [69, 70]" was there also a contribution by Peter
West? or maybe about dimensional reduction



sec 3:

- 3.5a-3.5c -- have you tried to honestly follow the logic here and
reproduce everything? as it seems you follow Minahan's review here,
some time ago when I tried to check it I thought this argument
wouldn't work if understood precisly as it's presented (maybe due to
some typos/small omissions). The problem had to do with the index
structure in 3.4. But I may be wrong on this.

- 3.52 - would be good to check, asJenia Sobko told me that there are
some wrong results (in some GKV papers possibly as well) in the
literature on what exactly is the Konishi at tree level

- section title "... asymptotic length" - maybe better "asymptotically
large length"

- before 3.65: for starters we only need the strong coupling -> did
you mean e.g. "for a start?"

section 4:

- beginning of sec 4: you say that slope is a bit abstract but will be
used for Konishi; in fact it was already used for Konishi dimension in
sec 3

- sec 4.1, 1st paragraph: Y-system in fact was proposed before TBA in
the GKV paper, maybe you shouldn't say that TBA was reformulated as
Ysys but rather e.g. it can be reformulated

- "are overwhelmingly diffi cult" maybe too strong

- sec 4.1.1: "In the spin chain picture we identify operators with
states of the chain and .." In fact the TBA is not derived from the
spin chain. It's derived from 2d integrable worldsheet theory on the
string side, its meaning from the spin chain picture is mysterious.
E.g. the key eqn 4.2 is derived in the 2d QFT.

- 4.5 would be valid only for a toy model with 1 species of particles,
you could mention this

- "one can to introduce
singularities" -> "one has to introduce
singularities"

- before 4.13 "this is done so that one
could rewrite" - I would say this is rather just a consequence of TBA
equations, Y-fucntions are defined here in the same way as for other
integrable models with TBA. Y-system also appears in many models, even
those w/o complicated analyticity.

- after 4.16: definition of Q with upper indices seems different from
Nikolay's long paper on Pmu; is it actually the same?

- sec 4.2.1 - you could menation that all this can be derived from TBA

sec 5:

- nice quote in the beginning of sec 5 :-)

- if I recall correctly there was a typo in 5.62 written in your
paper, remember to use the correct version


conclusions:
- "the very abstract problem of nding the spectrum of local" - not
really so abstract, CFTs describe critical phenomena in the real world

- "It was at weak coupling where we also found the first exact result"
- it's exact, so it wasn't really found at weak coupling

- "is non-local and the applicability of the construction is naively
questionable" yes, but we do know that it's described by TBA and by
same Y-system so it's not so surprising

- "which is another notorious integrable" - I think notorious has a
negative connotaion, right? maybe better - "celebrated" :)

- "there are just wild" -> "these are just wild"

- in the end of conclusions you can mention that already the *QCD*
pomeron was computed from the N=4 Pmu system

- shouldn't there be an Acknowledgements section?
